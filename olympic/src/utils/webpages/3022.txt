I think you may be checking the "This is a minor edit" box a bit too often[edit]


According to Help:Minor edit, examples of minor edits include "typographical corrections, corrections of minor formatting errors, and reversion of obvious vandalism." You can find examples of "major" edits here. Not sure? Help:Minor edit instructs: "if you are in doubt about whether an edit is minor or not, it is always safer not to mark it as minor." (In case you're curious, this edit is the one that prompted me to write.) Butwhatdoiknow (talk)
