Welcome to WikiProject Articles for creation! This is the project page for editors interested in working on Articles for creation, Redirects and Categories for creation and Files for upload.

If you would like to submit an article to Wikipedia, please use the Article wizard; alternatively, for redirects and categories, please use the Redirect wizard or Category wizard. If you would like to request a media file be uploaded to Wikipedia, please use the File upload wizard. If you simply wanted to suggest an article for someone else to write, please go to Requested articles.
Introduction


Only registered users with Autoconfirmed and confirmed user levels are allowed to create mainspace articles directly, so Articles for creation, which we call AfC, opens a path for new article creation. AfC works as a peer review process in which experienced registered editors can either help create an article submitted by an anonymous editor or decline the article because it is unsuitable for Wikipedia.


An article may be unsuitable for Wikipedia for a number of reasons. AfC submissions can be declined based on having insufficient content, consisting of vandalism or personal attacks, posting copyrighted material, not asserting notability (WP:N), and most often for not being properly sourced. We also do not accept new articles where a page on the topic already exists, even if under another name.


A lot of articles are posted at AfC and a dedicated team of editors is needed to review the requests. There is often a backlog, so please ensure submissions meet all Wikipedia guidelines to avoid repeated submissions and declines.

Brief history


On 5 December 2005, in response to the Seigenthaler incident, unregistered users were stopped from creating new pages on the English Wikipedia (read about it in the Signpost).


Consequently, the page Wikipedia:Articles for creation was set up by Creidieki&nbsp;(talk&nbsp;· contribs) and others, to allow unregistered users to submit articles for registered users to create on their behalf. The first page to be created was the redirect Fox Latin America requested by 140.247.23.58 (talk&nbsp;· contribs&nbsp;· WHOIS). The first article created was Horsea Island by Chemstud&nbsp;(talk&nbsp;· contribs).


Following huge backlogs on the page, Kwsn and others started WikiProject Articles for creation on 2 June 2007.

How to get involved


WikiProject Articles for creation needs you! Any editor who meets the criteria below can apply to be a reviewer for the project.
Reviewers must have:

a Wikipedia account at least 90 days old.
a minimum of 500 undeleted edits to articles.
thoroughly read and understood the reviewing instructions.
a demonstrated understanding of the policies mentioned in the reviewing instructions, including the various special notability categories.
reasonable evidence of understanding the deletion policy (experience in areas such as CSD/AfD/PROD or page curation, while not mandatory, are beneficial).
a willingness and ability to respond in a timely manner to questions about their reviews.


AfC submissions must be reviewed in accordance with Wikipedia's established content policies and guidelines. If you are unfamiliar with these policies and guidelines you should become familiar with them before conducting AfC reviews. Before you start reviewing requests, please ensure you have read the reviewing instructions thoroughly and that you ask an experienced reviewer if you are unsure about anything. The reviewing instructions cover reviews of article drafts, redirects and categories, and file requests. You can ask for help and advice at the Reviewer talk page. You can also get help in the live chat in Wikipedia's Live Help Channel. To request to join, follow the instructions at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Articles for creation/Participants.

Welcome template


This template is used to welcome new participants to the project. It can be added to a new participant's talk page by adding {{subst:AfC welcome}} to the bottom of the page:





Hi, and welcome to WikiProject Articles for creation! We are a group of editors who work together on the Articles for creation and Files for upload pages.


A few tips that you might find helpful:

Please take time to fully read the reviewers' instructions before reviewing submissions.
The reviewers' talk page is the best place to ask for help or advice. You might like to watchlist this page, and you are encouraged to take part in any discussion that comes up.
Article submissions that need reviewing can be found in Category:Pending AfC submissions and there is also a useful list which is maintained by a bot.
You might wish to add {{AFC status}} or {{AfC Defcon}} to your userpage, which will alert you to the number of open submissions. There is also a project userbox. If you haven't done so already, please consider adding your name to the list of participants.
Several of our members monitor Wikipedia's help IRC channel, and you are welcome to join in to ask Wikipedia-related questions.
The IRC channel #wikipedia-en-afc connect is used occasionally for internal discussion regarding the Articles for creation process, and also serves as a recent changes feed, displaying all edits made in the Articles for creation namespace.
The help desk is the place where new editors can ask questions about their submissions. You are welcome to help in answering their questions.


Once again, welcome to the project. ~~~~
