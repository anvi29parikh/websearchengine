If you would like to contribute to building a better world through sport, have a look at the current job openings.


A variety of profiles 


The IOC is composed of about 20 entities and departments with specific focus areas and responsibilities offering a wide range of positions: management of the relationship with our stakeholders (International Sports Federations, athletes, National Olympic Committees, TOP Partners, etc.), communication, digital engagement, marketing, cultural and educational programmes and activities, and operations such as finance, legal, corporate events and services (including catering and logistics), technology and information, human resources, and corporate security.


Apprenticeships 


At the IOC, we value learning opportunities for people at the beginning of their career in a sports organisation.


Every year, we offer multiple apprenticeship opportunities for young people in different areas, such as marketing/hospitality, finance and HR. Since 2000, the IOC has hosted and trained 21 apprentices in several different departments. Their youth and enthusiasm bring real added value to the organisation. Their training combines lessons and professional experience, which allows them to develop their knowledge and skills, learn on the job and gain experience of the professional world at a young age.


The IOC supports our young apprentices by offering them the possibility to learn about different sectors in an international environment throughout their apprenticeship. The training normally lasts three years, and the apprentices are required to change units every year, except for certain areas such as cooking.


For the IOC, apprenticeships allow it to maintain a link with local schools in the region and help to train future professionals. For the trainers at the IOC, this is also an opportunity to develop their own skills by taking an objective look at the work they do and to pass on their know-how.


Internships 


We also offer a wide variety of 6- to 12-month internship opportunities in multiple departments across the organisation: Olympic Games, Legal Affairs, Sports, HR, Corporate Events, IT and many more. IOC internships allow for bachelorâs and masterâs degree graduates to enter the working world with an opportunity to learn and grow within their respective fields. As an IOC intern, your manager and team will be there to support your development by setting clear objectives for the duration of your internship. They will then create opportunities for you to play a part in the everyday work of the organisation and support you in reaching your goals.


The IOC also has vibrant community of interns and former interns who look out for one another. Each new intern is welcomed into the community and is given a buddy who will act as a big brother/sister and provide guidance and support, especially in those crucial first few months in the organisation.


To find out more about what life is like as an IOC Intern, take a moment to listen to some of our interns talking about their experiences at the IOC.


Career transition for Olympians and elite athletes


Athletes are at the heart of the Olympic Movement, and it is never too early to start thinking about life after an elite sports career. Even if it should be a priority for every athlete, it can be hard to know where to begin. Whether youâre a retired athlete, an athlete nearing retirement, or an athlete considering a dual career â the IOC provides tools to help you figure things out via the Athlete365 platform.


The IOC also provide exclusive job opportunities to Olympians and elite athletes. Stay tuned and view the opportunities.
