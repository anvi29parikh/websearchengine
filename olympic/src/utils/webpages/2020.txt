The pages in this category are redirects from pages that are semi-protected from editing for any of several possible reasons.  When the Rcat shell template is used, this category will be populated automatically. To add a redirect to this category, place {{Rcat shell|(any appropriate rcats)}}  on the second new line (skip a line) after #REDIRECT&nbsp;[[Target page name]]. For more information follow the links. Never substitute redirect template(s), nor place them on soft redirects.
See also the complete list of redirect templates and the redirect style guide.
This is a maintenance category, used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project. It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories. 
This is a tracking category. It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme.

This category is hidden on its member pages—unless the corresponding user preference (appearance → show hidden categories) is set.
These categories can be used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience.
These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list (discriminated by classifications).
See also the categories Extended-protected redirects, Template-protected redirects, and Fully protected redirects


This category contains redirects which have been semi-protected. This is usually done to prevent vandalism or edit warring, or in cases where the page title is unsuitable for an article, but may be a plausible search term, as an alternative to deleting the page. Semi-protection prevents a page from being edited by anonymous and newly registered users.
Placing a redirect in this category does not in itself protect the page.  Actual page protection is engaged by administrators.
