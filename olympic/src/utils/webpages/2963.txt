Requests for permissions



ShortcutsWP:PERMWP:RFRWP:RFPERM


This page enables administrators to handle requests for permissions on the English Wikipedia. Administrators are able to modify account creator, autopatrolled, confirmed, file mover, extended confirmed, mass message sender, new page reviewer, page mover, pending changes reviewer, rollback, template editor rights and AutoWikiBrowser access.


Editors wishing to request a permission flag here should do so following the procedure below.  Editors requesting permissions are advised to periodically revisit the requests page, as notifications will not always be given after a decision is made.  Editors should not expect their request to be answered right away and should remember to be patient when filing a request.  To find out what permissions your account has, go to Special:Preferences, where your permissions are listed in the user profile tab under "Member of groups".


Requests for permissions are archived regularly; please see Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Archive for an index of past requests.


If this page has been recently modified, it may not reflect the most recent changes.
Please purge this page to view the most recent changes.

Permissions
Handled here
Account creator (add request • view requests): The account creator flag is granted to users who are active in the request an account process. The flag removes the limit on the maximum number of new accounts that can be created in a 24 hour period. It also allows users to make accounts with names similar to other accounts. The account creator flag is only given to users who participate in the ACC process and may be removed without notice should a user's participation in the account creation process cease.
Autopatrolled (add request • view requests): The autopatrolled flag is granted to users who are active in the creation of new articles. This tool is granted so their creations are auto patrolled in Special:NewPages. Unlike other requests, any user may nominate an editor for Autopatrolled, even without that user's consent. A user who wishes to have this flag generally should have created at least 25 articles and must be trusted, experienced, and must have demonstrated they are familiar with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, especially WP:BLP and Wikipedia:Notability.
AutoWikiBrowser (add request • view requests): AutoWikiBrowser is a semi-automated MediaWiki editor for Microsoft Windows, designed to make tedious repetitive tasks quicker and easier. It is essentially a browser that automatically opens up a new page when the last is saved. When set to do so, it suggests some changes (typically formatting) that are generally meant to be incidental to the main change. Please read the rules of use and registration requirements on the main page before requesting permission. This is not a true user right, but access needs to be granted by administrators just like other permissions. If approved, your name will be added to the CheckPage. Users with under 250 non-automated mainspace edits or 500 total mainspace edits are rarely approved. You will need to give a reason for wanting AWB access.
Confirmed (add request • view requests): The confirmed flag may be granted to new users who have not yet hit the threshold for autoconfirmed status. These are users who have not had both 10 edits and 4 days experience. People with this flag can  upload files and edit semi-protected pages before hitting the autoconfirmed flag. Users requesting this flag must indicate clearly why they should be exempted from the customary confirmation period.
Event coordinator (add request • view requests): The event coordinator user right allows editors to create multiple new accounts, and to temporarily confirm accounts so that they can create new articles.
Extended confirmed (add request • view requests): The extended confirmed flag is normally automatically added to accounts after 500 edits and 30 days, but may be added to legitimate alternate accounts of users that already have this access. The flag allows users to edit pages under extended confirmed protection.
File mover (add request • view requests): The file mover user right is intended to allow users experienced in working with files to rename them, subject to policy, with the ease that autoconfirmed users already enjoy when renaming Wikipedia articles.
Mass message sender (add request • view requests): Mass message sender enables users to send messages to multiple users at once. This flag is given to users who have made requests for delivery in the past, clearly showing an understanding of the guidance for use.
New page reviewer (add request • view requests): The new page reviewer user right allows users to mark pages as patrolled and use the page curation toolbar. At administrators' discretion, the right may be accorded on a time limited basis or indefinite.
Page mover (add request • view requests): The page mover user right allows users experienced in working with article names to move them, subject to policy, without leaving behind a redirect. They may also move all subpages when moving the parent page(s). General guidelines include making 3,000 edits and 6 months of editing history. At administrators' discretion, the right may be accorded on a time limited basis or indefinite.
Pending changes reviewer (add request • view requests): The reviewer flag is granted to users who are experienced enough with Wikipedia editing and its policies for contributing to the process of reviewing articles placed under pending changes.
Rollback (add request • view requests): Rollback enables users to remove vandalism much more quickly and efficiently than by undoing it. Users who do not demonstrate an understanding of what constitutes capable vandalism fighting, either because they have no or little history of doing so, or show a poor ability to discern between good and bad faith edits will not be granted this right. Also, it is unlikely that editors with under 200 mainspace edits will have their request granted. For a more detailed explanation of rollback and information about when it is appropriate to use the tool, see Wikipedia:Rollback. For information about the technical details of the feature, see here.
Template editor (add request • view requests): The template editor flag allows users to edit protected templates and Lua modules. General guidelines for granting include making at least 1,000 edits overall (with at least 150 to templates or modules), being a registered user for over a year, and having a record of successfully proposing significant edits to several protected templates. Users should demonstrate proficiency with template syntax and an understanding of the need for caution when editing heavily-used templates.
Handled elsewhere


Several permissions are requested and handled elsewhere:

Administrator and bureaucrat access: Requests for administrator or bureaucrat access need to be posted at requests for adminship and requests for bureaucratship, respectively.
Bots: Request for bot flags should be made at Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval.
Edit filter: Requests for access to the edit filter manager group and the edit filter helper group should be made at Wikipedia:Edit filter noticeboard.
Interface administrator: Requests for interface administrator access should be made at Wikipedia:Bureaucrats' noticeboard. Only current administrators may become interface administrators.
IP-block-exempt: While the IP-block-exempt right can be granted by administrators, this flag is not handled here. Requests for the IP-block exempt right should be submitted via the Unblock Ticket Request System or, if there are significant privacy concerns, email the checkuser team at checkuser-en-wpwikipedia.org or contact a CheckUser directly.
Checkuser and Oversight: These rights are only granted by the Arbitration Committee, and only after strict scrutiny. More information can be found here.
AfC reviewer: This access is granted by administrators at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Articles for creation/Participants.
Redirect patrol whitelist: Addition to the whitelist is granted by administrators at Wikipedia talk:New pages patrol/Redirect whitelist.
Steward permissions can only be granted in yearly elections, and are rarely given.
Global permissions such as global renamer, sysop, IP block exempt, rollback, etc should be made at meta:Steward requests/Global permissions.
Removal of permissions


If you wish to have any of your permission flags (except administrator) removed, you should contact an administrator. If you want your administrator flag removed, you should contact a bureaucrat.


This is not the place to request review of another user's rights. If you believe someone's actions merit removal of a permission flag, you should raise your concern at the incidents noticeboard. 


The bureaucrat, checkuser, and oversight flags are removed at meta:Steward requests/Permissions. Stewards will typically not carry out such requests unless they are made on behalf of the Arbitration Committee, by a user who is requesting their own access be removed, or in cases of an emergency.

Process
Requestors


To make a request for a permission, click "add request" next to the appropriate header and fill in the reason for wanting permission.


Any editor may comment on requests for permission.

Administrators
Full instructions at Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Administrator instructions


Administrators are permitted to grant account creator, autopatrolled, confirmed, event coordinator, file mover, mass message sender, page mover, pending changes reviewer, rollback and template editor flags to any user who meets the criteria explained above and can be trusted not to abuse the tool(s). Administrators may either grant these permissions permanently or temporarily. For convenience, a bot will automatically comment with relevant data if the user does not meet configurable qualifications. Even if the bot does not comment, administrators should review the user's contributions and logs to ensure the tools will be used appropriately and check for any indication of potential misuse.


Once an administrator has granted a permission or decided to deny a request, they should add {{done}} or {{not done}} respectively under the request with their comments. If a user already has the requested permission, or is autoconfirmed and requesting confirmed, {{already done}} should be used. N hours after the last comment was made (as specified by the config), the request will be archived automatically: approved requests will be placed here; declined requests will go here. See User:MusikBot/PermClerk#Archiving for more information on archiving functionality.

Hello I had a talk with a mod and he advised me to make some changes as to not make single edits that I undo as it could not help the encyclopedia, And also to request a name change to an article If i think it should be changed. I fully understand now and would like to have my extended confirmed rights back. Aaron106 (talk) 01:52, 28 November 2021 (UTC)

&nbsp;Automated comment This user has had this permission revoked in the past 180 days ([3]). — MusikBot talk 02:00, 28 November 2021 (UTC)
 Not done This was revoked just over an hour before your request here. That's far too little time for you to gain enough of an understanding for this permission. stwalkerster (talk) 03:39, 28 November 2021 (UTC)


@Stwalkerster: Why did you downgrade me from confirmed users just now? --Aaron106 (talk) 03:51, 28 November 2021 (UTC)

@Aaron106: because you're already in the implicit "autoconfirmed" group, which conveys the exact same rights as the "confirmed" group. There is no change to your effective rights. stwalkerster (talk) 03:57, 28 November 2021 (UTC)

I've closed or relisted somewhere north of 100 RMs (see [4][5][6][7], and I often find myself in situations where the page mover right would be useful. For instance, I sometimes need to move subpages ([8][9]) or to draftify without leaving a redirect ([10][11]), and there are many closeable RMs that I've passed over because they require round-robin moves that I'm not able to implement on my own. Only one of my closures has been challenged, and it was unanimously endorsed at move review (although that challenge has encouraged me to elaborate more in my closures, as I did here). I meet the criteria for granting and am otherwise familiar with relevant policies and guidelines, including the criteria for suppressing redirects and the procedure for conducting round-robin page moves.

I enjoy working with the WikiProject of Weather and I have been an active user for a little over two years.  I have also passed the 5,000 edit mark.  I would like to request the page mover permission as weather articles are normally started in draft space and as the event unfolds, notability is determined.  Having the page mover permission would be a little less work for administrators who have to delete weather drafts often after they have been moved and redirected to mainspace.

I am looking to become a pending changes reviewer as I often look at recent changes to revert vandalism. While I know there is a low backlog I am active almost every week and typically every day. I am somewhat aware of WP:BLP along with WP:NPOV, WP:NOR, WP:V and WP:NOT. While my request is being reviewed I will read up on all of the above mentioned policies.

Hiya there!


I would like to request the 'Pending changes reviewer' permissions. I have made over 8,205+ edits, and much of my time recently has been working the "Recent changes" pages. I am a member of the "CVU", and I have read over and agree with all of the Wikipedia policies in question for requesting this permission, namely: WP:BLP, WP:NPOV, WP:Verifiability, WP:WWIN, and WP:OR. I would appreciate this added permission as I continue to do all that I can in aid of the mission of the encyclopedia and maintaining the highest level of integrity for this great project!

I already have rollbacker status, and am relatively experienced in fighting vandalism with Twinkle, AIV, and RFPP. I also have a lot of experience answering edit requests. I have read Wikipedia:Reviewing pending changes and understand that the bar for accepting a pending change is lower than it is for implementing an edit request, i.e. I'd only need to make sure there are no policy violations in the pending edit, without needing to examine consensus. For both pending changes and edit requests, though, my belief is that most good-faith edits should be let through, and contributions from unregistered editors should be welcomed. ―&nbsp;Tartan357&nbsp;Talk 04:11, 28 November 2021 (UTC)

I wish to request for rollback rights, I do a lot of anti-vandalism/reverting unsourced changes work and I feel rollback rights would help me preform this work more effectively.


Before reverting any edits I always check the edit revisions to see what was changed. 


In terms of experience I have over 2 years experience and 5,000+ edits of editing experience, and whenever I revert vandalism I leave a warning on the users talk page. Maurice Oly (talk) 17:33, 19 November 2021 (UTC)

I had a look at your contributions and see little to no recent anti-vandalism work.  Any particular reason why Twinkle rollback is insufficient for your needs? -FASTILY 05:30, 20 November 2021 (UTC)
(notified about the question at User talk:Maurice Oly) ~ ToBeFree (talk) 21:21, 26 November 2021 (UTC)


After looking at few things I can now see that Twinkle rollback should be good enough for me, as I am not doing as much anti-vandalism/reverting work as I thought I might be doing right now and thus. &nbsp;Request withdrawn —&nbsp;Preceding unsigned comment added by Maurice Oly (talk • contribs) 22:12, 26 November 2021 (UTC)

Hi @Fastily: (or to whom it may concern, though I haven't seen anyone else actually approve this in a bit. 


I am applying again after having spent some time using the tools that you had mentioned that I use and the strategies/forms that are best practices for reverting vandalism. Primarily, I have been using Twinkle for quickly (somewhat) sending warnings between the levels 1–4, and ensuring that editors (whether IP or user) that post a questionable edit are properly warned. For those that are repeat offenders, I have been using the AIV now and blocks have been handed down in most cases. In only one case was the block not handed down, and that was because I removed the person form the AIV report list due to their having responded well to my final warning and actually ceased to be a vandal (go figure!). I have made over 7,192+ edits, and would like to request the rollback permission for the cases that it might simply be the best tool (over Twinkle etc.) for the job. I swear on my oath to the integrity of the encyclopedia to only use it sparingly and judiciously. Lastly, thank you for not actually just giving me the rollback permissions on my last ask, I would not have learned as much as I have if you had done that. ♥ Th78blue (They/Them/Their • talk) 00:44, 23 November 2021 (UTC)

&nbsp;Automated comment This user has had 1 request for rollback declined in the past 90 days ([12]). — MusikBot talk 00:50, 23 November 2021 (UTC)
 Not done Reverts &amp; warnings look good, but I'm concerned about your recent block for edit warring &amp; subsequent personal attacks.  I declined your previous request only a week ago, in which I suggested reapplying in a few weeks, after a sustained period of good edits.  Sorry, but this is simply too soon.  -FASTILY 03:06, 25 November 2021 (UTC)
I will reapply then in two more weeks? So that it is a total of three weeks then since my first application? Sound good? Thank you for the time you spent in reviewing my application again. I look forward to hopefully having this added permission soon. Have a great rest of your day. Th78blue (They/Them/Their • talk) 14:50, 25 November 2021 (UTC)
Could you please wait a month from today before reapplying?  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but given the circumstances, I would like to see a sustained period of good edits before granting you this right.  -FASTILY 10:57, 26 November 2021 (UTC)
Sure thing! I have never had another "incident" (and if you look into the details of that one, I think you will see that it was a bit interesting to say the least... I asked many questions of those involved, and none of my questions were ever answered), but I will gladly wait one month from the initial application date if requested to ensure that I am legit and then reapply. Much thanks! Th78blue (They/Them/Their • talk) 21:00, 26 November 2021 (UTC)
Th78blue, a month from "today" in the above comment is three days after "one month from the initial application date". Regarding "if requested": More than this has been requested. If three days are a problem and "Could you please wait" isn't enough of an explicit request, please reconsider your approach to permissions. From me personally, it would be "in 2022". ~ ToBeFree (talk) 21:04, 26 November 2021 (UTC)
I am more than happy to wait a month from today! I am sorry if I misread the above. Have a great day, and I appreciate ALL of your help. ♥ Th78blue (They/Them/Their • talk) 21:06, 26 November 2021 (UTC)
Just re-read it. The misread is entirely my own error. Sorry about that. I'll mark my calendar for one month from today! Thanks all. Th78blue (They/Them/Their • talk) 21:08, 26 November 2021 (UTC)
Ah, no worries, and thank you very much for your work as well. Do feel free to re-request after the waiting period; I'm certain that neither Fastily nor me are generally opposed to granting the permission. Enthusiasm is a good thing and usually helpful. ~ ToBeFree (talk) 21:10, 26 November 2021 (UTC)
Heh, I'd say you shouldn't. It's not about the date, it's about gaining some more experience before asking again. Usually, when a declining person has to specify a minimum date for repeated asking, the question has simply been asked too often and there is some impatience in play. Please take the time to consider whether it really has to be at 26 December 2021 at 11 o'clock, or if requesting the permission somewhere in 2022 is a more reasonable approach. ~ ToBeFree (talk) 21:14, 26 November 2021 (UTC)

I am request the rollback permission. I've been here for nearly two years and I regularly counter vandalism and rollback would be useful to me. Mvqr (talk) 17:49, 24 November 2021 (UTC)

I had a look at your contributions and see little to no recent anti-vandalism work.  Any particular reason why Twinkle rollback is insufficient for your needs?   Also, I found your unilateral mass reverts of categorization concerning; before performing mass reverts, why didn't you raise the matter at AN?  Agreed that we should deny substantial content contributions from LTAs, but can you point me to a discussion in which it was established, via consensus, that such additionscategorizations are genuinely harmful to the project? -FASTILY 03:06, 25 November 2021 (UTC)
Fastily, I do recent changes patrolling regularly, such as this edit this week. I didn't take the sockpuppet to AN because it was already blocked as a result of Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Jeuardt/Archive. The rationale of the revert was purely due to bans apply to all editing, good or bad and WP:BANREVERT ("Anyone is free to revert any edits made in violation of a ban, without giving any further reason..."). I later recognized that some of the sock's edits were actually good and re-instated them, and I will review this sock's contributions differently, I also plan on taking up categories a bit more. However Wikipedia policy (WP:BANREVERT) establishes that LTA edits may be reverted without discussion, the only exception of that rule is categories created by LTAs which does not apply here.--Mvqr (talk) 09:38, 25 November 2021 (UTC)
Sorry if I wasn't clear.  The sockpuppet being blocked is irrelevant.  As a rule of thumb, any large scale reverts should first be discussed at AN.  You said it yourself: "some of the sock's edits were actually good".  Had you gone to AN first, a handful of editors may have been willing to take responsibility for these edits.  Am I correct to assume that if you had the rollback right at the time you made these reverts, that you would have used rollback?  -FASTILY 10:57, 26 November 2021 (UTC)
 All understandable differences in opinion aside, I'm afraid that the existence of WP:ROLLBACKUSE #4, which explicitly allows using rollback for this purpose, makes it relatively hard to justify making the granting of rollback dependent on an answer to this question. ~ ToBeFree (talk) 20:55, 26 November 2021 (UTC)
Indeed, that's why I haven't declined OP's request.  I can't say I'm particularly comfortable with the possibility of them using rollback as a blunt force object, IMO it should only be surgically applied to offending diffs of egregious nature.  Mvqr, if you could give us some assurances, that would be much appreciated. -FASTILY 00:13, 27 November 2021 (UTC)
@Fastily and ToBeFree: I will be careful with rollback, in particular concerning categorizations. I can't promise I will never make any mistake, but I can promise that if I make a mistake I will own up to it, and discuss calmly with stakeholders.--Mvqr (talk) 06:29, 28 November 2021 (UTC)
&nbsp;Done Please remember that rollback should only be used on blatant vandalism.  If in doubt, don't rollback.  -FASTILY 11:44, 28 November 2021 (UTC)

Take a moment to check out what counter-vandalism is at WP:CVU, and if you decide you'd like to get involved, you can enroll at the Counter Vandalism Academy to learn more.

I am requesting for rollback rights, so i could revert such edits that doesn't meets with the Wikipedia.... Ttttt321 (talk). 15:46, 28 November 2021 (UTC)

&nbsp;Comment: Your recent edit history shows problems, like creating useless or wrongly named categories[13][14]. Additionally, it looks as if a number of your contributions have been made just for the sake of clocking those 500 edits[15][16]. — kashmīrī&nbsp;TALK 16:27, 28 November 2021 (UTC)
why [[Category:Sufi Poets of Kashmir]] is useless? Ttttt321 (talk). 16:34, 28 November 2021 (UTC)
Primo, "Kashmir" is spelled with capital K. Then, we already have Category:Kashmiri people and Category:Kashmiri poets and Category:Kashmiri Sufis. — kashmīrī&nbsp;TALK 17:29, 28 November 2021 (UTC)
yes, we have already these categories, but Category:Sufi poets of kashmir would contain those poets which are kashmiris and also relates with Sufism. for e.g, there is a category  "Kashmiri poets" which represents only poets of kashmir region in which many of them relates with Sufism and others aren't. So i create it to represent those persons, that are sufi poets, not only poets. Ttttt321 (talk). 18:36, 28 November 2021 (UTC)
 Not done You can already do this.  Rollback does not give you extra authority to undo edits.  No valid reason for granting rollback was provided.  -FASTILY 01:52, 29 November 2021 (UTC)

I revert high amount of vandalism and so I am requesting rollback rights. It would be easier to revert vandalism with rollback rights because I will have access to a large number of anti vandalism tools. So please grant me the rights. Itcouldbepossible (talk) 15:50, 29 November 2021 (UTC)
