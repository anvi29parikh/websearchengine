Redirect to:SHA-2 This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect:

From an alternative name: This is a redirect from a title that is another name or identity such as an alter ego, a pseudonym, a nickname, or a synonym of the target, or of a name associated with the target.
This redirect leads to the title in accordance with the naming conventions for common names to aid searches and writing.  It is not necessary to replace these redirected links with a piped link.
If this redirect is an incorrect name for the target, then {{R from incorrect name}} should be used instead.

When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
