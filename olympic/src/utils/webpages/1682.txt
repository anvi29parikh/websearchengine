Deletions[edit]


While deletions should also be available in the article news feed, you can also check and watchlist this dedicated page: Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Poland

New articles announcements[edit]


Newly created Poland-related articles are announced here (that page can be watchlisted). Click here for archival entries

Templates[edit]
Template:WikiProject Poland (short: {{WPPOLAND}}, full syntax: {{WikiProject Poland|class=|importance=}}) is our assessment template. Please add it to talk pages of all Poland-related articles, it is a key template that enables the article to be included in our article news, popularity ranking, project watchlist deletion discussion notifications the nifty quality and importance tables we have at the top of this page and other tools.
Use {{lang}} for Polish words or phrases, thus: {{lang|pl|Gmina Świnice Warckie}} will produce Gmina Świnice Warckie
The {{IPAc-pl}} template can be used to produce representations of Polish pronunciation.
When marking sources in Polish language, use {{In lang}} to produce (in Polish)
There is also a Portal:Poland/Welcome message box that can be used to notify new users about this noticeboard and our related projects. Just slap {{subst:Portal:Poland/Welcome}}--~~~~ on their usertalkpage - it has its own heading.
use {{Wikiquotelang}} to link Polish language wikiquote pages (often found on Polish Wikipedia articles). The full syntax is {{wikiquotelang|pl|article name|article name}}  (yes, it seems you need to use article's name twice), for example  {{wikiquotelang|pl|Stanisław Koniecpolski|Stanisław Koniecpolski}}
use {{Wikisourcelang}} just like Wikiquotelang above but for linking to Polish Wikisource articles.
Various other, less used templates are listed at Category:Poland templates
Userboxes[edit]

Awards[edit]


In the spirit of kindness and recognition we strongly encourage the use of the following barnstars, awards and assorted goodies:

Description
Ribbon




{{subst:The Barnstar of National Merit|message ~~~~}}

The Barnstar of National Merit


The Barnstar of National Merit may be awarded to an editor who contributes significantly to expand or improve Wikipedia's coverage of any given country.

It may also be awarded to those who create a particularly fine article on the subject of Geography.







{{subst:The Poland Barnstar|message ~~~~}}

The Poland Barnstar is an award placed at another users talk page for improving Poland-related articles.




{{subst:The Polish Barnstar of National Merit|message ~~~~}}

The Polish Barnstar of National Merit, 1st Class


The Polish Barnstar of National Merit, 1st Class is a specific variant of the Barnstar of National Merit, which may be awarded to editors who contribututed significantly to expand or improve Wikipedia's coverage of Poland. The 1st Class award should be used for very significant contributions (for example, getting an article to FA level). In most cases, the 2nd Class (below) will be sufficient.  As a rule of thumb, somebody should have already received a 2nd Class award before being eligible for the 1st Class.







{{subst:The Polish Barnstar of National Merit 2|message ~~~~}}

The Polish Barnstar of National Merit, 2nd Class


The Polish Barnstar of National Merit, 2nd Class is a specific variant of Barnstar of National Merit, which may be awarded to editors who contributed significantly to expand or improve Wikipedia's coverage of Poland. The 2nd Class can be given for various reasons, but if the contributor has done something really significant, and has already received this award, consider giving him or her a 1st Class award (above).







{{subst:The Rosetta Barnstar|message ~~~~}}

The Rosetta Barnstar


The Rosetta Barnstar may be given to any editor who exhibits outstanding translation efforts on Wikipedia. In the case of the Poland-related Wikipedia notice board of course, translations to or from the Polish language are most relevant.






		
			
			


For contributions related to Polish history during WWII

Are they B-class? We are providing small reviews for all B-class articles. See Wikipedia:WikiProject Poland/Reviews for outstanding review requests. Check Category:Poland articles with an incomplete B-Class checklist for an article missing a review, assess it whether it is a B-class or not, and leave a note on its talk page. It is quite simple, see an example.
