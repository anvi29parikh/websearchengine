Instructions for nominators[edit]


This page is for those nominations that have already been approved and are waiting to be promoted. If yours has been approved but has not yet been run on the main page, it should either be on this page or will soon be moved here, or already promoted to a Prep area or Queue ahead of an appearance on the main page.


If you wish to create a new nomination, please go to the Template talk:Did you know page; there are instructions there in a section similar to this one on how to nominate an article for DYK. 

Frequently asked questions[edit]
Backlogged?[edit]


This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until someone promotes it to a preparation area. To alleviate this problem, if the approved page has more than 120 approved hooks, then sets will change twice per day (every 12 hours) instead of once per day (every 24 hours). When the backlog falls below 60 approved nominations set frequency returns to once a day.

Where is my hook?[edit]


If you can't find the nomination you submitted to the nominations page, and it also isn't on this page, in most cases it means your article has been approved and is either in one of the prep areas, has been promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page. 


If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances.

Instructions for other editors[edit]
How to promote an accepted hook[edit]
See  Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for full instructions. Note that there are discussions currently under way for changing this process; if any changes are made, these instructions will be revised as necessary.
In one window, open the DYK nomination subpage of the hook you would like to promote.
In another window, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to.
In the prep set...
Paste the hook into the hook area (be sure to not paste in that that)
Paste the credit information ({{DYKmake}} and/or {{DYKnom}}) into the credits area.
Add an edit summary, e.g., "Promoted [[Jane  Fonda]]", preview, and save
Back on DYK nomination page...
change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage
change |passed= to |passed=yes
Add an edit summary, e.g., "Promoted original hook to Prep 3", preview, and save
How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit]
Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it.
Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section).
View the edit history for that page
Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again.
Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue.
Add a transclusion of the template back to the nominations page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from the nominations page.
If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so.

 It's new and long enough, so that's all fine, and the references seem fine too--but the article still needs work. I edited it a bit but it needs more copyedits--for phrasing, and for punctuation (comma splices). Also, the filmography needs some expansion; Cross the Line isn't in there, for instance. But the biggest problem I have is with the hook--a hook that's mostly a quote by someone else, that's not the greatest thing for DYK. Surely she's done some exciting things that can be turned into a hook? Drmies (talk) 18:08, 2 November 2021 (UTC)
@Thriley and Drmies: Would this work as an alt? ALT1 ... that when she was called to appear in her first film, Milena Smit was working as a hotel receptionist? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:06, 4 November 2021 (UTC)
User:Narutolovehinata5, that's the kind of thing I was thinking of, yes. Drmies (talk) 14:07, 4 November 2021 (UTC)
If an active version is preferred, ALT1 could also be rewritten as ALT1a ... that Milena Smit was working as a hotel receptionist when she was called to appear in her first film? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 14:10, 4 November 2021 (UTC)
I would prefer it to be something a bit more related to her film work. Currently thinking of another alt. Thriley (talk) 18:32, 5 November 2021 (UTC)
@Thriley: anything? If not, I suggest moving forward with ALT1a. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:24, 10 November 2021 (UTC)
@Theleekycauldron:, what about “in the film Parallel Mothers Penélope Cruz teaches Milena Smit how to make a potato omelet?” Thriley (talk) 03:03, 11 November 2021 (UTC)
I don't think that would be allowed under DYK guidelines, which require hooks about works of fiction (for example films) to have a real-world connection. Since that's technically a plot point I don't think it would meet the guideline. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:20, 11 November 2021 (UTC)

I mean, I ain't really involved in this, I'm just trying to get y'all talking—but yes, nlh5 is correct that the hook probably wouldn't fly under dyk guidelines. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 06:47, 14 November 2021 (UTC)
@Theleekycauldron: Sorry! I think ALT1 is fine. Thriley (talk) 15:43, 14 November 2021 (UTC)
 

Thriley, please see this. More copyedits are necessary. The next sentence has an erroneous comma. And the "first film" in the hook--isn't that actually her fifth or so? Do you mean "feature film" or some such thing? Thank you, Drmies (talk) 17:20, 14 November 2021 (UTC)
What about this hook? ALT2 “That in the Pedro Almodóvar film Parallel Mothers, Milena Smit and Penélope Cruz play pregnant women who give birth on the same day?” Thriley (talk) 20:46, 17 November 2021 (UTC)
@Theleekycauldron: Is this hook acceptable under the guidelines? Thriley (talk) 20:57, 17 November 2021 (UTC)
@Thriley: I'll ping BlueMoonset here in case I'm wrong, but I'm going to say no, it isn't. My reasoning here is that if the hook were read as plaintext, without any bolding or linking, it would be read as pretty much only interesting as it concerns the plot. The hook should concern Smit's life; if it concerns her work as an actress, only stating her role and not anything about production doesn't make the hook out-of-universe. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 17 November 2021 (UTC)
 theleekycauldron, I was taking a look at the ALT1 hook and its sources, and the second Biography sentence is basically copied from Esquire—the Google translate version, at any rate. That's a problem. Another problem is that the source doesn't actually say that she was working as a hotel receptionist when she got the call, just that it was "one of these jobs", referring back to the four in the previous sentence, none of which were hotel receptionist. The article also needs a bit of copyediting. I don't think that either of the plot-based hooks should be used, and as Drmies notes, "first film" is not accurate, since it's Cross the Line that's in the source, which appears to be her fifth film. We could only use "first feature film" if the previous four in her filmography were all short films (which would need to be clearly sourced). Perhaps an angle for the information in ALT1 would be to say she was working in whatever job it was when she was cast in Cross the Line, for which she was nominated as best new actress in the Goya Awards. BlueMoonset (talk) 02:31, 18 November 2021 (UTC)
Here’s an article that states she was working as a receptionist two years before she was hired to work on Parallel Mothers:[1] Does it appear reliable? Thriley (talk) 05:38, 20 November 2021 (UTC)
I don't see a reason to doubt the source. However, it isn't sufficient to support the "when she was called" hook claim, just that she was a hotel receptionist two years before the article was written (and possibly two years and a number of months, since you can't assume it's exactly two years). BlueMoonset (talk) 17:14, 21 November 2021 (UTC)
Perhaps the hook should include all her various jobs before her Almodovar role? Thriley (talk) 01:47, 23 November 2021 (UTC)
ALT3 “before starring in the Pedro Almodóvar film Parallel Mothers, Milena Smit worked as a model, waitress, shop assistant, babysitter, teleoperator, subway information assistant, and hotel receptionist?” El País Thriley (talk) 01:51, 23 November 2021 (UTC)
That hook is 197 characters which puts it in discretionary territory. Given though that the hookiness here is that she did all of these non-acting jobs, I think in this case the length is justified since it hasn't reached the limit. I say ALT3 is pretty good and can be approved. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 23:23, 23 November 2021 (UTC)
If others find the hook too long, one possibility could be to delete the mention of Almodóvar. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 02:51, 24 November 2021 (UTC)
 

@Narutolovehinata5: if you approve the nomination, would you mind adding the green ticky thang? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 18:22, 24 November 2021 (UTC)
I'm not the original reviewer, so I'd like to hear from either Drmies or BlueMoonset first if they're fine with ALT3. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 22:59, 24 November 2021 (UTC)
in that case, I'd wager that it'd be helpful to ping Drmies. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 01:43, 25 November 2021 (UTC)
theleekycauldron, I'm fine with it--thanks. User:Narutolovehinata5, I wouldn't have known without the ping. Drmies (talk) 01:47, 25 November 2021 (UTC)
Thank you. Pinging BlueMoonset for their thoughts on ALT3. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 01:48, 25 November 2021 (UTC)
This isn't yet ready to be approved. ALT3 is too long: you need to include the initial "that ", which takes it to 203 characters, so I've struck it. Further, there is no mention of "teleoperator" in the article, and the sourcing does not properly support the other jobs: the Esquire source was placed after the hotel receptionist sentence, but does not support it (the one linked above here, to Olive Press, does); Esquire does cover the waitress, shop assistant, subway info assistant, and babysitter jobs, so I've moved the source there. (It also covers "model", and is properly cited there.) The hotel receptionist sentence, When she was called for her first movie she was working as a hotel receptionist., remains dubious; the source merely says that she had been working at that job two years earlier, as previously noted, not that she had that job when she was cast in Cross the Line, which may have been her first full-length feature film, but does not appear to have been her first movie. These things need to be cleaned up in the article before the nomination can proceed. Advantages to dropping "teleoperator" from the hook is that you don't need to add it to the article and source it, and the hook drops to 189 prose characters, which would be eligible. (Almodóvar is a name that adds interest, so better to keep it, I think.) Here's the resulting hook, assuming the article fixes are done:
ALT3a:  ... that before starring in the Pedro Almodóvar film Parallel Mothers, Milena Smit worked as a model, waitress, shop assistant, babysitter, subway information assistant, and hotel receptionist? BlueMoonset (talk) 04:11, 25 November 2021 (UTC)
ALT3a looks great! I removed the hotel receptionist sentence. No doubt there will be further reporting on her biography as the years go on and this detail can be clarified. Thriley (talk) 05:31, 28 November 2021 (UTC)
@Drmies: could you formally approve the nomination with the tick if ALT3a is good? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:20, 28 November 2021 (UTC)
, with ALT3a. I made a few more copy edits. Thriley, this took a bit too long for my taste, and part of it was simple--the article simply wasn't ready. Thanks, Drmies (talk) 22:29, 28 November 2021 (UTC)

 Its long enough and new and lots of good refs - including the hook fact. It documents a notable woman from the 14th century and there were not many of those. There is no image, its well written and I offer an alternative phrasing of the hook, but its up to someone else to decide if its ok. No evidence of close paraphrasing I could see. Nice addition. well done Victuallers (talk) 10:31, 6 November 2021 (UTC)
 Reopening this because I think the hook is misleading, as according to the source it was usual for women of the nobility, like Neville, to sign with their own names. Gatoclass (talk) 02:10, 19 November 2021 (UTC)
@Gatoclass: I don't think most will know that, so maybe we go with ALT1 or some variation on it? We don't need to say it's unusual if we phrase it that way theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:14, 19 November 2021 (UTC)
Theleekycauldron, the problem with both hooks is that they imply that there was something out-of-the-ordinary in a woman signing something in her own name in that era, whereas the source indicates that was normal practice for women of the nobility. So the hooks are misleading. Gatoclass (talk) 02:19, 19 November 2021 (UTC)
All right—I'll ping @Lajmmoore and Victuallers: back here, y'all can work this out. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 02:33, 19 November 2021 (UTC)
Was it usual for women in the fourteenth century to sign with their own name ... no. Is is usual for women in the 21st century to sign with just their first name? No. So "did you know that unusually Canada's head of state signs documents with just her first name and an R for Regina?" (Someone shouts) "BUT all British Queens do that!!" (Someone shouts) "That implies that it was unusual for Queens to sign with just their first name." No it doesnt. I think @Gatoclass: is reading the source and then saying that the hook doesnt explain every piece of information in the source... which obviously it doesnt. Its unusual that "a woman" is doing this at all. It WAS unusual for women in the fourteenth century to sign and if they did then they did not usually use just their own name. Its a fact - its unusual. Did You know that women did not sign their own names on documents in the 14th century? No I didnt. That is something that Lajmmoore wrote about and now I know. Thanks. Victuallers (talk) 08:28, 19 November 2021 (UTC)
Hello Gatoclass all so the part of the source I was using is this, which is talking about signatures for charitable donation "Although most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter, others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names, such as 'domina Margareta de Longvl' and 'don-ýina Margareta de Nevill' (the same person). The majority of widows declare that their marital status and their power to act, using a variety of phrases, including 'in pura viduitate', 'in pura viduitate mea et ligia potestate', and 'in viduitate mea propria et potestate legitima' ..." and I read that as it was more usual for (noble) women to use a signature that described them as "wife of, etc..." I read the passage as Legg using Margaret de Neville as an unusual example. Legg is talking about the Coucher Book signatures specifically, but I still think they are marking out unusual practice. In terms of the hook, I wonder whether changing 'woman' to 'literate woman' might work? Lajmmoore (talk) 09:32, 19 November 2021 (UTC)
No, it wouldn't work just to add "literate". And your reading of the text just amounts to an unsupported assumption on your part. Because while the text could admittedly be less ambiguous, the statement that others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names does not in any way suggest that it was rare or unusual for a member of the nobility to give their name, it only states that members of the nobility as a class were inclined to give their names. So there isn't sufficient support in that statement for a hook which implies that Neville's act was in any way unusual for a member of her class. The hook makes Neville sound like some sort of proto-feminist who boldly challenged the system, when the underlying source only indicates that either her entire class did the same thing, or at least that it was an accepted practice for members of the nobility. So I still think that either the hook needs to be substantially reworked to more closely reflect the source, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 02:53, 20 November 2021 (UTC)
Thanks for sharing your interpretation of your text Gatoclass. My interpretation (&amp; so the hook) is based on Legg's use  of the word most - in that "most of the widows declare themselves to be the wife of their late husband, or their father's daughter" and you rightly point out "others, who were members of the nobility, simply give their names" but I think that needs to be balanced by the "most" earlier in the sentence i.e. for women generally, they don't give their name, but some noble women do but overall, for women signing their name, it is unusual enough to be pointed out in the text. Lajmmoore (talk) 09:00, 20 November 2021 (UTC)
Gatoclass main hook only. Debate seems to have ended. Victuallers (talk) 11:49, 26 November 2021 (UTC)
 Sorry I forgot to get back to this. The issue with ALT0 is that it says her signing her own name was "unusual for a woman", but there is no indication in the text that it was unusual for a noblewoman, in fact the text if anything suggests the opposite. So I still think the hook either needs to be reworked for accuracy, or a new hook be found. Gatoclass (talk) 12:35, 26 November 2021 (UTC)


Given the vagaries of the text, it might be best to just quote the ambiguous phrase more or less verbatim:

hello Victuallers, hello Gatoclass - thanks for suggesting ALT2 - it's generous of you. I'm going to suggest a different one:

Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/13/us/ohio-bank-robber-dead-massachusetts.html A year before, Mr. Conrad had been obsessed with “The Thomas Crown Affair,” a 1968 Steve McQueen film in which a bored billionaire robs a bank to amuse himself. Mr. Conrad had told friends that he planned to rob a bank, bragging about how easy it would be, the U.S. Marshals Service said.
ALT2: ... that Theodore Conrad, who evaded capture for 52 years after stealing $215,000, remained a fugitive for so long that he was finally tracked down by the son of one of the original investigators?

Elliott asked his father, a U.S. marshal in Cleveland, Ohio, who was thinking about the man who had pulled off one of the biggest bank robberies in the city’s history.  'When am I going to get Ted Conrad?' Mr. Elliott asked his son, a year after Theodore J. Conrad had walked off with $215,000 in cash, the equivalent of about $1.6 million today.

I am not, however, seeing a ref that supports hook 1: the provided reference says “Spotify always sees a jump in app store rankings in early December following the Year in Review campaign,” analyst Kevin Rippey said in a note. This is not quite the stock price.

@Theleekycauldron: As I recall, Newsweek was only listed as unreliable due to its acquisition by IBT in 2013 (and it was sold in 2018). That said, I didn't see a whole lot cited to Newsweek (there's only three cites for it). Most of it is stuff like as well as their activity on the platform over the past year, which seems like very basic information. If something else can be found for those sentences, however, I don't see why we can't add another source. jp×g 08:05, 27 November 2021 (UTC)
theleekycauldron, I'm impressed by the attention to detail! I left Newsweek in because I hadn't been able to find a more reliable source for the content it was supporting, but a little motivation goes a long way: I believe this will solve the problem?

Victoria wearing the Koh-i-Noor

... that Queen Victoria (pictured), as sculpted by William John Seward Webber in Harrogate's Jubilee Memorial, wears the Koh-i-Noor diamond in her necklace? Source: "Unveiling the statue of Queen Victoria at Harrogate", Leeds Mercury, 7 October 1887: "This is a statue of the Queen in white marble ...  Her necklace contains the famous Koh-i-Noor."
Reviewed: Thomas Guggeis
Comment: This article was created over about 5 months in userspace, then copied and pasted to mainspace on 16 November. As far as I am aware, Queen Victoria never wore the Koh-i-Noor set in a necklace, though she did wear it set in a brooch and in a circlet (headdress). So the necklace with the Koh-i-Noor in this sculpture is probably artistic licence.

 Captivating storey of a life and career, meticulously referenced on plenty of fine sources, offline sources accepted AGF, no copyvio obvious. The image is licensed. The hook works, but I don't see the diamond in the image. I am willing to approve it but would like to discuss other options:
mention the artistic license, because I didn't know the detail of her not wearing that gem in a necklace
don't mention the diamond detail, focus on the jubilee, and use the second image from the gallery which show the greatness of the design better than the head detail
base a hook on the Warrior/Youth work which I find much more attractive as an artwork, and as an image in small size&nbsp;;)
Let me know. Take that article to GA please, I think it's ready. - Graham87, can you please do the history merge for him? --Gerda Arendt (talk) 06:57, 18 November 2021 (UTC)
@Gerda Arendt: I didn't do the history merge because it's not needed. Graham87 09:41, 18 November 2021 (UTC)
@Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the review. Diamonds were often cut in cabochon style in the 19th century and earlier. This one was cut with a flat bottom like all cabochons, and when viewed from above, it was a large oval, about 1.5 inches long. Modern cabochons usually have a smoothly rounded surface; this one was lightly faceted but the facets don't show on the sculpture. So it looks like half an egg, I suppose. The Koh-i-Noor is the large oval at the bottom of the picture.
We have no specific citation for artistic licence - that is just a conclusion that we can probably make, since we have no evidence that Victoria ever had it set in a necklace. Therefore I cannot use "artistic licence" in a hook or in the article.
I'll have a go at a hook using a full-length Victoria, and another hook using the Warrior and Wounded Youth sculpture. I'll come back shortly with those. Storye book (talk) 16:55, 18 November 2021 (UTC)

Pamzeis How about replacing "her" for "Swift's" in ALT0? (t · c) buidhe 22:14, 23 November 2021 (UTC)
 Works for me. ALT0 is approved with the second instance of Swift replaced with her and without the image. Pamzeis (talk) 00:50, 24 November 2021 (UTC)
@Pamzeis and Ippantekina:  You know, it kind of makes me laugh to say this, because we could literally write that taylor swift is the goddess-queen of music and have literally no impact in promoting her art and brand. However, ALT0 rests on a primary source (an interview), and I don't think that we'd accept this kind of introspective hook for a smaller songwriter who doesn't the massive amount of name recognition if the hook rests on a primary source. If it were a quote in a mostly secondary article, fine, but I don't think this fits. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 07:42, 27 November 2021 (UTC)
...what? I'm confused, lol (no, I wasn't actually laughing). Pamzeis (talk) 07:47, 27 November 2021 (UTC)
can't land every joke, apparently :l. @Pamzeis, my point was that ALT0 is sourced to an interview, which is a primary source. Primary sources are generally discouraged for DYK facts, and since this hook gets into non-trivial details about the song, I'm not inclined to promote it. If the fact were sourced to a quote from swift in an article that's still mostly a secondary source, I'd run with it, but this is not that. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 07:50, 27 November 2021 (UTC)
the joke I was making is that it's laughable to the point of hubristic to think that we could have any impact on taylor swift's marketing by writing a promotional or shakily-sourced hook, because she's just such a widely recognized artist. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 07:51, 27 November 2021 (UTC)


 If ALT0 does not work, could ALT1 or 2 replace anyhow? Ippantekina (talk) 00:55, 28 November 2021 (UTC)
@Ippantekina: not if Pamzeis doesn't approve one or the other, no. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 07:59, 29 November 2021 (UTC)
@BlueMoonset: is there a general idea that hook citations should be secondary sources, or does it not matter? theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 08:00, 29 November 2021 (UTC)
I provided a secondary source to corroborate the claim -- "In the CD's booklet, Taylor Swift provides an explanation of her definition of the word 'fearless'... it is essentially a concept album about overcoming obstacles, ostensibly written about the experiences of teenagers" Ippantekina (talk) 08:42, 29 November 2021 (UTC)

Overall:  this is *mostly* good to go. Sources look good, article and hook are both interesting reads. I will note that there is a slight discrepancy with a couple values in the infobox; the main website for the game says ages 8+ and a 45-minute playing time, while the Meeple Mountain review says ages 10+ and 30-to-60-minute playing time (which I note are the values used for the infobox). These issues are quite small, though. --Dylan620 (talk) 19:18, 28 November 2021 (UTC)

@Dylan620:I've piped the hook link (I thought I had already done that). As far as the typical game length and recommended ages are concerned, I used a review site because most reviews state a recommended age of 10+. T3 states that "suggested age of 10+ seems right on the money", so perhaps the change to 8+ on the publisher website is recent. Game length times differ from all sources. I've reset them to the suggestions by the publisher, but if you prefer another option, let me know. Mindmatrix 19:52, 28 November 2021 (UTC)

QPQ: Done.



Overall:  Article meets eligibility criteria. 5x expanded. Length criteria is met. Article is well sourced and is neutral in tone. Earwig's copyvio indicates no plagiarism. Hook is interested. It is sourced. No issues there. Would be good to have the statement used as-is in the article. Something for the nominator to consider. But, I am good with or without that.

@Ktin: Added a QPQ and modified the hook and article a bit. SounderBruce 06:00, 19 November 2021 (UTC)
@SounderBruce: QPQ done. The new hook ALT1 seems to be covered by the source, but, seems to be weirdly worded at the source. Essentially, the paragraph starts "So are the..." and "So is the ..." assuming this ties back to the previous paragraph where it says "The girls and the fountains are the work of Italian artisans." Marking this hook approved. Ktin (talk) 00:16, 22 November 2021 (UTC)

 The article was made on the 15th, so is new enough. It is more than long enough and reads neutrally, with in-line citations. The hook is short enough, neutral, cited in-line, and interesting. I do have a suggestion though:
Alt1: ... that backgammon was derived from the esteemed 16th-century Scottish and English tables game of Irish and eventually surpassed it in popularity?
I think that would be clearer to our readers than "superseded". Anyways, regardless of the hook chosen, we're still waiting on the QPQ before I can approve. SilverserenC 08:56, 20 November 2021 (UTC)

Overall:  Article meets eligibility criteria. i.e newness and article length. Article is well sourced and is neutral in tone. Hook is interesting and is cited. Copyvio scores ~20% in major part due to a quote that has been attributed rightly. However, the nominator might want to consider removing the quote and rewriting the sentence because the original Nepal Times article does not have it as a quote and is likely a paraphrasing done by the newspaper to begin with. Hence, we should not include it as a quote. In addition, I would encourage the nominator to consider expanding the article - to be clear, the article is good to go as-is. But looking at Hanuman Dhoka for instance there is an opportunity to build this article more than just a "History" section. Handing it back to the nominator. Some work and this is ready for homepage. Good luck. Ktin (talk) 17:57, 24 November 2021 (UTC)

Overall:  I think it's appropriate to mention WP:DAILYMIRROR here, although because the hook explicitly references the Mirror in the quote I think that's probably okay. That said, the article doesn't fully reflect this – whereas the hook says "according to the Daily Mirror...", the article states that it was Asprey who said it. There's also a missing citation in the "Career" section. I've done some MOS and copy-editing, but left these for the nominator to resolve, presumably with sources that exist and have already been used in the article. I think resolution of those things above will be fine – perhaps a slight CE/rw of the hook to be:

ALT1 ... that George Asprey was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth – according to the Daily Mirror, it was a silver shovel?
ALT2 ... that according to the Daily Mirror, George Asprey was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth but a silver shovel?
ALT3 ... that because of his family's wealth, the Daily Mirror said that George Asprey was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth but a silver shovel?


MIDI (talk) 11:12, 24 November 2021 (UTC)

Article text specific to the hook now reflects the reference, but there are a few unsourced parts – the text in the Career section which states "he portrayed Jonathan Rees QC in The Barking Murders", as well as much of the filmography.

Comment: Note that ALT1M/ALT2M are singular hooks with Majestic Theatre only, and ALT1B is a double hook with Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre and John Golden Theatre only. If so desired, ALT1M/ALT2M could run separately from ALT1B, hence two hooks. I will come up with more hooks later.


5x expanded by Epicgenius (talk). Self-nominated at 20:45, 24 November 2021 (UTC).

Verified all three articles 5X recently expanded. The hook is stated in all three articles, attributed to the same source which does state the same fact. I think the hook is interesting, but adding "traditional" highlights the fact that this was different than the way it was usually done prior.
ALT0A: ... that the Majestic Theatre, Royale Theatre, and Theatre Masque were all designed with a single balcony because its developer, Irwin Chanin, thought a traditional second balcony was distant?
Epicgenius, if you are OK with ALT0A, this will be good (with the needed QPQs). Note: when I tried to download/view the NYC Landmark Preservation Commission PDF that supports the hook, I got a "potential security risk" notice from Firefox. Had no problem with Chrome where I have it set to view PDFs in the browser. MB 05:45, 27 November 2021 (UTC)
@MB: Thanks for the review. I've done the three required QPQs now. I'm fine with ALT0A, but if you think any of the combo hooks are contrived, I can split it up into two or maybe three hooks (the combination hooks are slightly interesting in my opinion, but they can be better). Weird thing about the sourcing, though, as the LPC documents work fine for me; it could just be the security certificate. Epicgenius (talk) 04:27, 28 November 2021 (UTC)
Epicgenius, Last time I reviewed one of yours, I picked the last hook and you said you listed them in order of your preference. This time, I went with your first hook. As far as the other hooks, I don't like ALT1 that much. ALT2 is interesting. I like ALT1M and ALT1B too, so if you would rather have two or three hooks, we can do that also. You did all the work in the articles, so it's up to you. For now, with three QPQs, ALT0A is good to go.  MB 04:50, 28 November 2021 (UTC)
@MB: Thanks, I appreciate it. It is true that I listed them in the order of my preference; however, these are just my preferences, and I don't mind if you feel that other hooks are better. In this case, my preference would be the combo of ALT1M and ALT1B, followed by ALT0A and ALT2. Epicgenius (talk) 04:58, 28 November 2021 (UTC)

buidhe, I've struck ALT0 since I don't think it's as interesting as the other two. Based on a reading of WP:SCHOLARSHIP it looks like the source from the UC Merced journal is not reliable other than perhaps to show the views of the groups represented by those journals – so I think it's okay to leave the mention of the review, which is clearly attributed, but I've removed the portion of the synopsis that's currently sourced to that review.

 @AFreshStart: Nominated for DYK less than a day after creation, and is about 3000 bytes, satisfying date and length criteria. I'll assume good faith for the references I cannot access. Per Wikipedia:Did you know/Supplementary guidelines#Other supplementary rules for the article point D2, each paragraph should have at least one citation. In the article, it states "...until 1767, whereby his former master Lisle saw Strong..." and subsequently the meeting between Sharp and the Lord Mayor. According to page 217 of "Account of the Late Granville Sharp...", Sharp approached Robert Kite, who is listed as lord mayor for only 1766. Can you reconcile those date discrepancies? (I do see that the Hochschild ref mentions the event as 2 years later from 1765, so there is some inconsistency in the reference material too.) Original hook is suitably short, interesting, and sourced in the text. ALT1 is not mentioned in the article at all (see WP:DYKCRIT points 3a and 3b). QPQ not required. As an aside: it would be useful to have page numbers with each citation (for example, by using {{rp}}). Mindmatrix 21:04, 24 November 2021 (UTC)

 Substantial article on an interesting book, on fine sources, subscription sources accepted AGF, no copyvio obvious. The images proposed are licensed, and I prefer the "chief" as showing better when small. I suggest we make a hook around it. I like about the original the fact about engravings after his drawings, but believe that not many people will be able to trace from "Hanks" and the title that one of Cook's voyages is meant, - better provide a year, or mention that. The "published by his brother" bit is not making it dramatically more interesting. - The botanical names bit seems less interesting for the general public, - who knows Harold St. John enough to make it work? (... or am I the only one?) - In the article, I'm not happy with text "sandwiched" between images, more than once. An infobox would take care of one such instance, and would clarify facts from the start. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 13:23, 28 November 2021 (UTC)
I've moved the frontispiece to top. I'm not including an infobox at the moment so I don't have to make any hard genre/author decisions, where infoboxes tend to lose subtlety. The only left-aligned image is the one looking to the right now, a standard use case for left-alignment per MOS. The advantage of the aborigines is that we actually have an article discussing that image (I only found out after writing about the book): Two of the Natives of New Holland, Advancing to Combat. But I agree that the tattooed Maori chief is a more stunning image. I don't have a lot of information about the engraving in this case, but we could just go with fairly basic information and take the Maori as an example. I agree that the hyphen question isn't as stunning on first glance, but overall the history of the botany of the South Pacific is quite fascinating, with lots of arguing about correct names and many things published several times, mostly because Joseph Banks hoarded all the information and never published his Florilegium. Anyway, here are some ALTs to go with the Maori chief (whose caption I have changed a little). Let me know what you think. —Kusma (talk) 11:15, 29 November 2021 (UTC)

Thank you for thinking and explaining. The "names" hook might be used if we don't have room for an image, but I do hope that we will.

Article history )

... that the map in the game MicroMacro: Crime City depicts victims of a crime for the players to solve? Source: "Solving those crimes is the goal of the game, ranging from the relatively innocuous theft of a top hat to murder most foul, all illustrated in a surprisingly cheerful, cartoony way considering the gruesome subject matter.  The crimes themselves are not depicted, but clues to solving them are, cleverly designed to show multiple moments going backward in time.  This allows the players to "follow" the path of the victim (and perpetrator) as they travel across the city, revealing hints as they go along." Review: 'MicroMacro: Crime City' (board game)

 Interesting article. Earwig's is fine, the article is new enough and long enough, references all appear to be reliable, the article is within policy. Hooks are cited in the article and are broadly interesting, but they have to include the real-world in some way, so I've struck ALT0, leaving us with ALT1. I do think there is something to say about the game being scalped in a hook (the source says "Right now the $29.99 game is being scalped on Amazon for $99.99"), but this is interesting, too. I verified ALT1 and the article for accuracy and the source corresponds to the text, so that's great. QPQ done, good to go for ALT1. Urve (talk) 06:15, 27 November 2021 (UTC)

Review: Is it new? This article was created on November 28 and I couldn’t find correlation between its content and other Wikipedia articles. Is it long enough? Meets this requirement without issue. Is it within policy? I find no obvious issues with neutrality or sourcing and no evidence of plagiarism from English-language sources.
On to the hook… It’s short enough, neutral and appealing. However, I find myself a bit stumped by how exactly he “reduced” his age. Was it by government sanction, fraudulent means, something else…? I believe that some clarification about the circumstances would be beneficial so that the general population can understand what is being said. QPQ was done. There is no image… Yet, the article has a PD image in the infobox. Illustrating the topic is not mandatory, but it helps the presentation.
Verdict?  For now… But, I’m inclined to give this a “Yes” as soon my question about the alteration of his official age is clarified. - Caribbean~H.Q. 06:19, 29 November 2021 (UTC)

5x expanded by Nkon21 (talk). Self-nominated at 23:03, 17 November 2021 (UTC).

  Hook is interesting, within prescribed limits and is well cited. AGF on sources written in Japanese. Images have no issues. QPQ completed. However, 5x expansion is short by 355 characters.  Please add some more information and the article will be good to go. -- Gwillhickers (talk) 22:21, 18 November 2021 (UTC)
@Gwillhickers: I believe that the 5x threshold has now been reached. I also feel that this hook should be saved for December 25, any thoughts? ɴᴋᴏɴ21 ❯❯❯ talk 01:46, 19 November 2021 (UTC)
 Looks good. Article is good to go. Having the article listed on Dec. 25 would not be up to me. We can request that it would appear under DYK on that date:

... that the album series Jingle Cats spawned Jingle Dogs, Jingle Babies, and a Japanese video game in which "the object is to breed and care for cats, which begin to sing when they’re done copulating"?

Comment: The version prior to my expansion is 668 characters and a 5x expansion of that is 3440 characters. The article is currently 3,665 characters. DYKcheck says that it isn't a 5x expansion due to unsourced promotional content that was removed in 2013. I would like to have this be my first special occasion hook with the date being Christmas.

Comment: review underway—you've been at DYK for like seventy years and you haven't made a s.o. request yet? damn theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 22:38, 18 November 2021 (UTC)
 *American male advertiser's voice* Introducing, the all-new 100% plagiarism-free long-enough article with quality sourcing and adherence to the policy of neutral point of view.[a] Hook is cited inline and interesting, and a QPQ has been done. No ALT suggestions on this one, we'll leave it be. I love how "spawned" perfectly captures "inspired, but not in a good way". Good to go, nice work! theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 22:47, 18 November 2021 (UTC)
Theleekycauldron And here I was being not ready to turn 30 years old in 2 years. Now I realize that I was hiding from the fact that I'm over 70 years old. SL93 (talk) 23:06, 18 November 2021 (UTC)

note: per request on my talk page, this shouldn't be held for christmas day. theleekycauldron (talk • contribs) (they/them) 21:28, 20 November 2021 (UTC)
Per talk, this is okayed again for Xmas day. —valereee (talk) 18:22, 24 November 2021 (UTC)

... that in Spain it is considered lucky to eat 12 grapes while wearing red underwear received as a gift at midnight on New Year's Eve? Source: https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/12/26/168092673/green-grapes-and-red-underwear-a-spanish-new-years-eve "If scoffing grapes at midnight isn't strange enough, convention says you must do so while wearing red ropa interior, or underwear — a bra, a sock, a garter, whatever. And — stranger yet — the undergarment should be given to you by someone else."

Comment: Request a special occasion slot for New Year's Eve or New Year's Day. I'm hoping to develop more ALTs (and possibly an image), but would like to get at least one approved so that this can get slotted, and I'll update alts/image as the article develops.

 Recently moved to mainspace, long enough to qualify for DYK, but certainly room for expansion, no copyvio concerns. Brilliant hook, sourced to NPR as stated, which I'd like to try myself except I don't believe I've got any red underwear to hand. Ah well, I'll put it on the Christmas list. Please put in the New Year slot as appropriate. Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) 13:25, 12 November 2021 (UTC)
Thanks for the review, Ritchie333! —valereee (talk) 20:53, 14 November 2021 (UTC)
