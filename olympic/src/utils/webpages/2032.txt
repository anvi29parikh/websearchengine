Fix a typo in one click


Hi, I watch the Fix a typo in one click page and disagreed with some of your recent tags so I have redone them. In general if you are unsure it is best to leave the word for someone else to correct. A Google search of the word in question can confirm it is a real word, e.g. frum, ssam and exites. I was baffled by the article Seifert fiber space. TSventon (talk) 18:11, 6 April 2021 (UTC)

@TSventon: Sorry, I was having some technical difficulties. My apologies for wasting your time. ―&nbsp;Qwerfjkl|✉&nbsp;&nbsp; 18:31, 6 April 2021 (UTC)
No problem, I "corrected" frum to forum a few weeks ago. TSventon (talk) 21:29, 6 April 2021 (UTC)
Pointless edits?


Hello, what are your recent edits about? They don't seem to change anything. 𝟙𝟤𝟯𝟺𝐪𝑤𝒆𝓇𝟷𝟮𝟥𝟜𝓺𝔴𝕖𝖗𝟰 (𝗍𝗮𝘭𝙠) 09:47, 13 April 2021 (UTC)


The former edit was an accident, and the latter changed  {{R to section}} to {{R to anchor}} . Apologies for making a few pointless edits. ―&nbsp;Qwerfjkl|✉&nbsp;&nbsp; 09:51, 13 April 2021 (UTC)

Spacing


Please respect &amp; maintain the empty line between the #REDIRECT ... line and {{Redirect category shell}} line when making such mass changes. Thanks. &nbsp;&nbsp;~&nbsp;Tom.Reding (talk ⋅dgaf)&nbsp; 19:23, 12 April 2021 (UTC)

@Tom.Reding: Sorry!, I was using a script which did not enter that line (Sagittarius). I will try to manually add it in the future. &nbsp;Thanks ―&nbsp;Qwerfjkl|✉&nbsp;&nbsp; 19:52, 12 April 2021 (UTC)
I don't think doing WP:Cosmetic edits like this manually is worth it either. You could try using one of the modified versions of the script though. 𝟙𝟤𝟯𝟺𝐪𝑤𝒆𝓇𝟷𝟮𝟥𝟜𝓺𝔴𝕖𝖗𝟰 (𝗍𝗮𝘭𝙠) 09:52, 13 April 2021 (UTC)
@1234qwer1234qwer4: Unfortunately, the other versions of the script do not work for me. ―&nbsp;Qwerfjkl|✉&nbsp;&nbsp; 09:53, 13 April 2021 (UTC)
I have managed to run Capricorn by using desktop mode, so will automatically add the line. ―&nbsp;Qwerfjkl|✉&nbsp;&nbsp; 20:47, 13 April 2021 (UTC)
This is the correct format to use for future edits. Not worth correcting previous edits, as it would be a WP:Cosmetic edit. &nbsp;&nbsp;~&nbsp;Tom.Reding (talk ⋅dgaf)&nbsp; 13:16, 13 April 2021 (UTC)
Reviewing Wikipedia:Articles for creation/Redirects and categories


Hi, I see you have reviewed a redirect request, but you have not closed the submission.  Please see Wikipedia:Articles for creation/Redirects and categories/Reviewing instructions.  Alternatively, you can use User:Enterprisey/AFCRHS.js, which creates the redirect and closes the discussion for you when you have reviewed a submission. ~ Aseleste (t, e | c, l) 03:38, 17 April 2021 (UTC)

Template:R from ambiguous term


I don't know how these tools work, as I've never tried them, but in your semi-automated edits to redirects using sagittarius and Capricorn, {{R from ambiguous term}} would be an appropriate template to put on those redirect pages. – wbm1058 (talk) 21:50, 17 April 2021 (UTC)

 Thank you, I was just using the wrong rcat. ―&nbsp;Qwerfjkl|✉&nbsp;&nbsp; 21:58, 17 April 2021 (UTC)
Disambiguation link notification for April 25


Hi. Thank you for your recent edits. An automated process has detected that when you recently edited Participatory development communication, you added links pointing to the disambiguation pages Planner and Implementer. Such links are usually incorrect, since a disambiguation page is merely a list of unrelated topics with similar titles. (Read the FAQ&nbsp;•  Join us at the DPL WikiProject.)


It's OK to remove this message. Also, to stop receiving these messages, follow these opt-out instructions. Thanks, DPL bot (talk) 06:00, 25 April 2021 (UTC)

Thanks for thanking my edit! It means a lot to me. HiCooldude😎 (talk) 21:03, 29 April 2021 (UTC)

Declined speedy


Just as a note, I've removed your A7 tag on Madeleine de Choiseul. I don't tend to inform people when I do because it can seem patronizing to long-term users, but I noticed you were a newer user and felt you could do with a friendly note. 🙂 The subject of that article was a monarch, which is definitely a claim to notability, and in addition anyone who lived before or in the earliest days of the printing press and had their name written down is at least not an A7 case; she did live in its earlier decades, so more ambiguous than before (when it's a common position that anyone whose name was recorded is notable, full stop), but still far back enough in history that an A7 tag for the most clear-cut possible cases of non-notability should be held back from. You might want to read Wikipedia:Credible claim of significance, which is a helpful guide to when A7 does and doesn't apply, as well as Wikipedia:Common claims of significance or importance, which lists some cases an article doesn't count as A7, even if it wouldn't survive AfD. Vaticidalprophet 22:23, 2 May 2021 (UTC)

Thank you for notifying me! ―&nbsp;Qwerfjkl|✉&nbsp;&nbsp; 19:45, 6 May 2021 (UTC)
Redirect request: Category:Video game cheating


You declined this request because "You are suggesting a category, not a redirect."  However, the person was requesting a category redirect (just a redirect from category namespace), not requesting a category.  (I'm not the person who asked for it; I just saw the request.)  74.98.192.38 (talk) 19:19, 6 May 2021 (UTC)

Thank you, I just misread it and have now accepted that request. ―&nbsp;Qwerfjkl|✉&nbsp;&nbsp; 19:46, 6 May 2021 (UTC)

SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways based on other articles you've edited, including straight text similarity, following wikilinks, and matching your editing patterns against those of other Wikipedians.  It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work.  We appreciate that you have signed up to receive suggestions regularly; your contributions make Wikipedia better — thanks for helping!

A discovery of Witches


Why did you find it necessary to revert to a ref that points at a "404" page when there's and perfectly good page in the original citation?--Georgia Army Vet Contribs Talk  21:34, 7 May 2021 (UTC)

Hi, I've come across a few pages where you edited some typos from Typo Team. While it's great and very helpful that you are fixing those, could you also delete those fixed entries/words from the list? That way everyone can see what still needs to be done&nbsp;:) Strickesel (talk) 10:16, 12 May 2021 (UTC)

Which pages specifically did you mean? By typo team do you mean Wikipedia:Typo Team/moss? ―&nbsp;Qwerfjkl&nbsp;&nbsp;(please use {{reply to|Qwerfjkl}} on reply) 15:22, 12 May 2021 (UTC)
@Qwerfjkl: Ah, yes, I meant specifically Wikipedia:Typo Team/moss/M, the current page I saw you fixing things from. I could have been more specific, sorry&nbsp;:) Strickesel (talk) 15:36, 12 May 2021 (UTC)
@Strickesel:I run AWB and JWB on all the pages listed, but cannot check whether or not all the errors have been caught, so I tend to leave them fo others to check. ―&nbsp;Qwerfjkl&nbsp;&nbsp;(please use {{reply to|Qwerfjkl}} on reply) 16:12, 12 May 2021 (UTC)

 Hello. Regarding the recent revert you made to List of home video companies: you may already know about them, but you might find Wikipedia:Template messages/User talk namespace useful. After a revert, these can be placed on the user's talk page to let them know you considered their edit inappropriate, and also direct new users towards the sandbox. They can also be used to give a stern warning to a vandal when they've been previously warned. Thank you. Hockeycatcat (talk) 10:37, 15 May 2021 (UTC)

I am aware of the messages, and also have Twinkle and RedWarn to add these messages, I just forget occasionally. Thanks! ―&nbsp;Qwerfjkl&nbsp;&nbsp;(please use {{reply to|Qwerfjkl}} on reply) 10:41, 15 May 2021 (UTC)

Rollback granted



Hi Qwerfjkl. After reviewing your request, I have temporarily enabled rollback on your account until {{{expiry}}}. Keep in mind these things when using rollback:

Getting rollback is no more momentous than installing Twinkle.
Rollback should be used to revert clear cases of vandalism only, and not good faith edits.
Rollback should never be used to edit war.
If abused, rollback rights can be revoked.
Use common sense.


If you no longer want rollback, contact me and I'll remove it. Also, for some more information on how to use rollback, see Wikipedia:Administrators' guide/Rollback (even though you're not an admin). I'm sure you'll do great with rollback, but feel free to leave me a message on my talk page if you run into trouble or have any questions about appropriate/inappropriate use of rollback. Thank you for helping to reduce vandalism. Happy editing! GirthSummit (blether) 10:18, 5 June 2021 (UTC)

@Girth Summit What is the expiry date? ―&nbsp;Qwerfjkl&nbsp;|&nbsp;𝕋𝔸𝕃𝕂&nbsp;&nbsp;(please use {{reply to|Qwerfjkl}} on reply) 10:20, 5 June 2021 (UTC)
Qwerfjkl, oops - sorry, forgot to change that. I didn't set an expiry date, it's indefinite (unless you misuse it, obviously). Cheers GirthSummit (blether) 10:23, 5 June 2021 (UTC)
Thanks! ―&nbsp;Qwerfjkl&nbsp;|&nbsp;𝕋𝔸𝕃𝕂&nbsp;&nbsp;(please use {{reply to|Qwerfjkl}} on reply) 10:24, 5 June 2021 (UTC)
 Malicious editing 


 Please stop your disruptive editing. If you continue to spiteful messages, as you did more than once on my talk page, you may be blocked from editing. 76.160.6.50 (talk) 21:45, 5 June 2021 (UTC)

CZTS


This entry on David Mitzi is unneeded &amp; misleading. David Mitzi is only one of 7 researchers. Zero info on CZTS was removed. The same research paper is also cited above: "Device Characteristics of CZTSSe Thin-Film Solar Cells with 12.6% Efficiency" "Wei Wang, Mark T. Winkler , Oki Gunawan , Tayfun Gokmen, Teodor K. Todorov,Yu Zhu, and David B. Mitzi" The lead researcher is usually listed 1st in a research paper, Wei Wang. David Mitzi is listed dead last; IE, least contribution. This reads just like a resume. 71.218.243.31 (talk) 21:23, 6 June 2021 (UTC)

If the article's statement "He is the most recognized scientist to hold several record efficiencies of CZTS solar cells including the latest achievement of a 12.6% cell for CZTSSe at IBM.[1]" is correctly sourced and true, then this does seem relevant, although perhaps not relevant enough to warrant its own section. Please discuss this on the talk page. ―&nbsp;Qwerfjkl&nbsp;|&nbsp;𝕋𝔸𝕃𝕂&nbsp;&nbsp;(please use {{reply to|Qwerfjkl}} on reply) 21:31, 6 June 2021 (UTC)
You do not appear to have read what I have written. It is not correctly sourced, and very unlikely to be true. His only "source", is the research paper I mentioned:  "Device Characteristics of CZTS Se Thin-Film Solar Cells with 12.6% Efficiency" This is the work of 7 different researchers, of which he contributed the least. This research paper, does not list any additional information about him. Please re-read what I have written above. Please read the below abstract of the paper, and see for yourself.


Device Characteristics of CZTSSe Thin-Film Solar Cells with 12.6% Efficiency

A 12.6% Cu2ZnSnSxSe4–x (CZTSSe) solar cell is presented with detailed device characteristics. Both short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) increase in the 12.6% champion, relative to previous devices, due to better bulk CZTSSe quality and improved optical architecture. The reduction in Voc deficit shows opportunities to push CZTSSe solar cells to higher efficiency. 71.218.243.31 (talk) 21:47, 6 June 2021 (UTC)

Fair enough. Sorry for rolling back your edit! ―&nbsp;Qwerfjkl&nbsp;|&nbsp;𝕋𝔸𝕃𝕂&nbsp;&nbsp;(please use {{reply to|Qwerfjkl}} on reply) 21:51, 6 June 2021 (UTC)

Confusing edit at Metamorphic rock


Regarding [1], your edit-summary is about the compound word "stairsteps", but it looks like the only thing your edit did was re-order the hatnotes. DMacks (talk) 16:29, 8 June 2021 (UTC)

@DMacks Sorry, I decided not to change to stairsteps, but did not update the AWB edit summary. ―&nbsp;Qwerfjkl&nbsp;|&nbsp;𝕋𝔸𝕃𝕂&nbsp;&nbsp;(please use {{reply to|Qwerfjkl}} on reply) 16:35, 8 June 2021 (UTC)
Okay, no worries. I was just wondering if I was missing something, or you had a generally-misbehaving AWB recipe. DMacks (talk) 16:43, 8 June 2021 (UTC)

Hello,
I dont understand whats going on. now my draft is declined due to "not appear to be written in the formal tone expected of an encyclopedia article" when all along since it was approved the sources were the problem? how can this be and what excatly isnt written in the formal tone? can you explain please since i made sure its written good and a few editors already reviwed it and the pnly problem was the sources&nbsp;? --Shanisun (talk) 07:49, 9 June 2021 (UTC)

Administrators' newsletter – June 2021


News and updates for administrators from the past month (May 2021).




 Administrator changes

 Ashleyyoursmile • Less Unless
 Husond • MattWade • MJCdetroit • Carioca • Vague Rant • Kingboyk • Thunderboltz • Gwen Gale • AniMate • SlimVirgin (deceased)


 Guideline and policy news

Consensus was reached to deprecate Wikipedia:Editor assistance.
Following a Request for Comment the Book namespace was deprecated.


 Technical news

Wikimedia previously used the IRC network Freenode. However, due to changes over who controlled the network with reports of a forceful takeover by several ex-staff members, the Wikimedia IRC Group Contacts decided to move to the new Libera Chat network. It has been reported that Wikimedia related channels on Freenode have been forcibly taken over if they pointed members to Libera. There is a migration guide and Wikimedia discussions about this.


 Arbitration

After a Clarification request, the Arbitration Committee modified Remedy 5 of the Antisemitism in Poland case. This means sourcing expectations are a discretionary sanction instead of being present on all articles. It also details using the talk page or the Reliable Sources Noticeboard to discuss disputed sources.
