Numismatics (ancient Greek: νομισματική) is the scientific study of money and its history in all its varied forms. While numismatists are often characterized as studying coins, the discipline also includes the study of banknotes (notaphily), stock certificates (scripophily), medals, medallions, and token coins (also referred to as exonumia).

Scope[edit]


This WikiProject aims to create articles relating to all kinds of coins, tokens, bills and modern forms of money, and to standardize the content and format of data in those articles. In addition, this WikiProject aims to provide some degree of damage control for poorly written or extraneous numismatic articles.


To create consensus on what should be included, provide factual information on all the world's past and present payment systems and create a consistent look and style for each type of page: Coins, paper money, tokens, medals and other forms of money.
