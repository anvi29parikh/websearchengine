C: Created submissions.  See Category:Pending AfC submissions in article space for tips on catching copy-and-paste moves and handling articles that never went through AFC.
D: Submissions which duplicate mainspace titles (Category:AfC submissions with the same name as existing articles, count=85).
M: Misplaced submissions.
P: Pending submissions, not yet reviewed.
R: Submissions which are being reviewed now (as category, count=0).
If you plan to make breaking changes to this category, move it, change scope, or nominate it for deletion or deprecation, please notify the Article Alerts project at Wikipedia talk:Article alerts as a courtesy, as this page is used by the AAlertBot bot to detect and report pages. Thank you!

 Looking for your submission?
 Click for some tips:&nbsp;


If your article is still waiting to be reviewed, and correctly tagged with a template at the beginning, then it will appear in the category below.
If the submission does not have a template, please add the code {{subst:submit}} to the beginning to properly submit the article.
Declined submissions can be found in Category:Declined AfC submissions. Click here for a list of recently declined articles.
Alternatively, try searching by the date your article was submitted: articles submitted today can be found in Category:AfC submissions by date/29 November 2021.
If you have the same IP address, or are logged with the same username, that you used to edit the submission with, you should find a link to your submission in your contributions.
If your article was accepted then it will now be in article space. If so, you should have a note about it on your talk page. Otherwise, the talk pages of all accepted submissions are in Category:Accepted AfC submissions and a list of recent changes to these pages can be found here.
