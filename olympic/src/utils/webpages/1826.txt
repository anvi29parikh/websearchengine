WikiCon is short for "Wikimedia/pedia Conference" or "Wiki… Convention" . For more information about Wiki events by those names see:

de:Wikipedia:WikiCon – WikiConventions (or conferences) of the German-speaking community since 2011
Wikimedia Conference is used inconsistently in two ways
The official, WMF sponsored m:Wikimedia Conference is the invite-only, non-public, "annual meeting of representatives of Wikimedia Chapters and Affiliates, Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees and other movement groups like the Affiliations Committee or the Funds Dissemination Committee." Affiliates must meet certain guidelines in reporting outcomes and filing reports before they are allowed to attend.
In more casual use, it describes local conferences that have been taking place since 2008, such as:
m:Chinese Wikimedia Conference – 2006 &amp; 2009
m:Wikimedia Conference Israel – since 2006
m:Wikimedia Conference Japan – 2009
m:Wikimedia Conference Netherlands – since 2006
West Coast WikiConference 2011 in San Francisco
