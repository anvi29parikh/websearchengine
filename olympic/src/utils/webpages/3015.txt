Random page patrol is a Wikipedia communal patrol which refers to the process of regularly and frequently checking randomly selected pages through Special:Random. The primary goal of random page patrollers is to ensure random articles conform to Wikipedia's policies on content and style as well as the related guidelines. Secondarily, that style and formatting is consistent and meets the basic principles laid out in Wikipedia's Manual of Style. The guidelines for the New pages patrol and Recent changes patrol also apply, merely the search method is different.


The patrol is entirely voluntary and carries no obligation. Plus it's fun! There are currently 6,415,292 articles on Wikipedia, so you never know what you may come across, and it's always a treat when you discover that one treasure of an article or page.


Random-page patrollers are usually also WikiGnomes. If you wish, you can add your name to the list of RP Patrollers.
