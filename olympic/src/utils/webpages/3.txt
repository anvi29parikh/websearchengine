The International Olympic Committee is the guardian of the Olympic Games and the leader of the Olympic Movement.


A truly global organisation, it acts as a catalyst for collaboration between all Olympic stakeholders, including the athletes, the National Olympic Committees, the International Federations, Organising Committees for the Olympic Games, the Worldwide Olympic Partners and Olympic broadcast partners. It also collaborates with public and private authorities including the United Nations and other international organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp; 


The vision of the International Olympic Committee is to Build a Better World through Sport.

        
    

        IOC principles
        
            The IOC is at the very heart of world sport, supporting every Olympic Movement stakeholder, promoting Olympism worldwide, and overseeing the regular celebration of the Olympic Games. The IOC is also committed to promoting sport in society, strengthening the integrity of sport and supporting clean athletes and other sports organisations.

        The IOC as an organisation
        
            Established in on 23 June 1894, the International Olympic Committee is a not-for-profit independent international organisation. Based in Lausanne, Switzerland, the Olympic Capital, it is entirely privately funded and distributes 90 per cent of its revenues to the wider sporting movement, for the development of sport and athletes at all levels.
