Tlp as a far right Islamic party[edit]


Please make me clear what is far right Islam&nbsp;?
ISLAM is not what Zakir Naik tells you or somebody like Mufti Menk.
Prophet Muhammad PBUH clearly said that who insults him............... 
A Westerner  cannot change Islam, if they try what happened to them you can see in Afghanistan.
What are reliable sources, aren't around 60 percent of 200 million people reliable.
These sources only see Taliban or any other Muslim executing people but don't see CIA and US army doing war crimes. Hyperforever (talk) 17:41, 30 October 2021 (UTC)

@Hyperforever: If you're confused on what constitutes a reliable source, you can read the policy here. PohranicniStraze (talk) 00:29, 31 October 2021 (UTC)

World Financial Group[edit]


Hello,


I submitted a change to update the opening paragraph for World Financial Group. The source for the company being an MLM was a redirect to the New York Times Home page with no mention of World Financial Group.


Is it possible to know what was wrong so I can update that paragraph?


Thank you in advance.  —&nbsp;Preceding unsigned comment added by Gotjus (talk • contribs) 20:32, 9 November 2021 (UTC) 

@Gotjus:I am not sure which source you are referring to; it appears to me that the MLM claim is sourced to an International Herald Tribune article, which makes the claim quite explicitly: "One thing about the unit, based in Duluth, Georgia, that sets it apart from traditional sales forces is structure. As a pyramidlike, multilevel sales organization, World Financial...". If you have a reliable source demonstrating that the claim was mistaken, or that it was true but no longer is true, then you should probably post it to the talk page (where the statement has been discussed previously) and try to find a consensus for rewording.
Also, I notice that your only edits to the project are related to World Financial Group. I am not saying you have a conflict of interest, but it does give the appearance that you may have some connection to the subject. If that is the case, then you may want to find a different area of the project on which to focus. PohranicniStraze (talk) 03:03, 10 November 2021 (UTC)


Thank you for the feedback. I must have looked at the source wrong. When I clicked on the link it went to NYT. I have made edits other pages like Georgia State when I see things that don't line up. I just couldn't remember my old un and pw from when I made the change to GSU.  —&nbsp;Preceding unsigned comment added by Gotjus (talk • contribs) 16:20, 10 November 2021 (UTC)

Looking for help arbitrating a page you frequently edit[edit]


Heya. I'm taking this one step removed from the talk page of IGN because I know that it's super gross here to self edit and I'd rather not discuss this on the Talk page. That said, if that's where you guide me, that's where I'll go&nbsp;:)


I was the co-founder of IGN way back in 1996, along with Jonathan Simpson-Bint. For the last 15 years Jonathan has been the only person listed as founder and because of the rules against self-edits, I've left that sit. A few months ago someone added me as the co-founder (with source) and that was then reversed a few days ago as a "fake reference" by an anonymous user. I was fine not being listed in the article, but being removed bugs me for some reason. There are a dozen reputable sources on the web, including TechCrunch, Business Insider and AllThingsD, that reference me co-founding IGN. What's the best way to resolve this?


Thanks. Bpm140 (talk) 21:15, 23 November 2021 (UTC)
