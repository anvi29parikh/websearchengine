Empower Athletes


The Athletes’ Declaration was developed to benefit Athletes globally. Athletes are at the heart of sport, and we wanted to continue our drive to strengthen support to them by making sure their voice is heard.
                
                                
                    

Tackle key issues


In collaboration with the athlete community, the project tackles the most relevant issues they face today, including integrity and clean sport, governance and communication, careers and marketing, safeguarding and competition.

                    It’s essential that Athletes not only have a voice, but also take part in the decision-making process, especially in Africa, so we can achieve higher results and have higher standards and better conditions for Athletes to stay on our continent and contribute to developing more sports.

                    I think this is a fantastic opportunity for Athletes to share their voice and make their voices heard, resulting in a set of key principles to help Athletes understand their rights, roles and responsibilities in the world of elite sport.

Here we address key questions that sports organisations within the Olympic Movement, such as National Olympic Committees (NOCs), International Federations (IFs) and National Federations (NFs), may face when developing their athletes’ agreements.
