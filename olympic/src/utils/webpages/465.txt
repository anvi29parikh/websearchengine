            Gangwon 2024's vision: Korea's youth together for a peaceful and better future&nbsp;


Gangwon 2024 draws upon the successful delivery of the Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018, and aims to continue their vision of bringing winter sport to a new generation of athletes.


Local youth engagement and mobilisation are a top priority. Focus can be placed on this, as the experience gained from PyeongChang 2018 will facilitate core Games operations.


The Winter Youth Olympic Games Gangwon 2024 will use many of the PyeongChang 2018 sports facilities. This legacy will represent a top-level experience for the young athletes competing in Gangwon.


Since its creation in September 2020, the Organising Committee has been working with the IOC on developing the Edition Plan. It will serve as a baseline for the work of the Organising Committee for the years to come.

The postponement of the Dakar Youth Olympic Games from 2022 to 2026 will strengthen the mobilisation of young people in the organisation


Senegalese President Macky Sall sent a video message conveying hope and resilience to the Olympic family. âSport is first and foremost a school of life that teaches tolerance, acceptance and respect for others,â&nbsp;he said.


Dakar 2026 will be by, for and with the youth. During the additional years of preparation, following the postponement from 2022 to 2026, emphasis will be placed on the large-scale mobilisation of young people from all regions of Senegal and their involvement in the organisation. They will thus be able to benefit from the preparatory activities and feel connected to the great celebration of the YOG in 2026.


President Sall declared that everything would âbe ready in timeâ&nbsp;for Dakar 2026, whose vision â âyouth and sport united to contribute to the transformation of Senegal, and a source of inspiration for Africaâ â could not be more relevant at the current time.

The Youth Olympic Games (YOG) were established by the IOC as a high-level multi-sports event. They represent a unique combination&nbsp;of athletic performance, a purpose-driven sports festival and an incubator for innovation.&nbsp;Young elite athletes aged from 15 to 18 come together, breathe life into the Olympic values, develop their sports skills, and share their experiences.&nbsp;The next YOG will take place in Gangwon (South Korea) in 2024 and in Dakar (Senegal) in 2026.
