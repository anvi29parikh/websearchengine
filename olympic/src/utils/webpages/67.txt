The Olympic Museum is a destination and a content creator, as product are distributed by the cultural hub.


The Olympic Museum in Lausanne (Switzerland) (TOM) is the essential storyteller for the Olympic idea. The Museum is not about a collection, it is about an idea: Olympism. Its vocation is to let people discover the Olympic Movement, witnessing its essential contribution to society, and to transmit the Olympic values beyond the celebration of the Games and competitions.


History, culture, design, technology and sociology are some of the themes addressed beyond sport, in turn reflecting the richness and diversity of Olympism.
