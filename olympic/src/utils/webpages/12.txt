The IOC Executive Board&nbsp;has proposed&nbsp;a new strategic roadmap, Olympic Agenda 2020+5,&nbsp;to the upcoming IOC Session.&nbsp;

Consisting of 15 recommendations, it builds on the results of Olympic Agenda 2020 and&nbsp;act as the roadmap for &nbsp;the IOC and the Olympic Movement&nbsp;for the next five years.&nbsp;The title,&nbsp;Olympic Agenda 2020+5,&nbsp;has been chosen to reflect&nbsp;the fact that&nbsp;this new roadmap&nbsp;is the successor to&nbsp;Olympic Agenda 2020 and&nbsp;will determine the direction of the IOC and the Olympic Movement&nbsp;until 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;


The 15 recommendations are based on&nbsp;key trends that have been identified as likely to&nbsp;be decisive in&nbsp;the post-coronavirus world. They&nbsp;are&nbsp;also&nbsp;areas where&nbsp;sport and the values of Olympism can play a key role&nbsp;in turning challenges into opportunities.


The&nbsp;key&nbsp;trends include:&nbsp;

    the need for greater solidarity within and among&nbsp;societies;&nbsp;
    the growth in&nbsp;digitalisation,&nbsp;while keeping in mind the need to expand digital capability to the&nbsp;currently&nbsp;digitally&nbsp;underserved;
    the urgency&nbsp;of&nbsp;achieving&nbsp;sustainable&nbsp;development;&nbsp;
    the growing demand for credibility, both of organisations and&nbsp;institutions;&nbsp;and
    the&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;build&nbsp;resilience in the face of the financial and economic&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;that will&nbsp;result from the&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;pandemic and&nbsp;which will&nbsp;influence priority-setting among governments and enterprises.&nbsp;



The 15 recommendations, which&nbsp;have been inspired by these trends, call upon the IOC and the Olympic Movement to:&nbsp;

    Strengthen the uniqueness and the universality of the Olympic Games
    Foster sustainable Olympic Games
    Reinforce athletesâ rights and responsibilities
    Continue to attract best athletes
    Further strengthen safe sport and the protection of clean athletes
    Enhance and promote the Road to the Olympic Games
    Coordinate the harmonisation of the sports calendar
    Grow digital engagement with people
    Encourage the development of virtual sports and further engage with video gaming communities
    Strengthen the role of&nbsp;sport as&nbsp;an important enabler for the UN Sustainable Development Goals
    Strengthen the support to refugees and populations affected by displacement
    Reach out beyond the&nbsp;Olympic community
    Continue to lead by example in corporate citizenship
    Strengthen the Olympic Movement through good governance
    Innovate revenue generation models.
