If you are an Olympic athlete, there are a few ways that you can get involved in the work of the Commission. You can stand as a candidate in the elections organised at each edition of the Olympic Games or you can vote to elect representatives of your choice.


You can liaise with the Athletesâ Commission of your NOC or IF or you can forward your comments to the IOC Athletesâ Commission

IOC Athlete Career Programme



In February 2005, the IOC launched the IOC Athlete Career Programme (IOC ACP), which now comprises three main axes:



Education: providing information, a list of criteria and a checklist enabling athletes to undertake a âdual careerâ (sport and studies) in the best conditions.



Life skills: making available practical files giving athletes information, advice or a checklist concerning subjects related to their daily lives (nutrition, the fight against doping, financial planning, etc).



Employment: services related to career preparation and management (drafting CVs preparing job interviews, etc.) offered to the athletes, during and after their high-level sports career.
