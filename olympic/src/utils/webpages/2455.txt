2021 Regional Meetings




In 2021, the CC Global Network Executive Committee (ExCom) is pleased to introduce support for a Regional Meeting Series. The ExCom has identified a current need for more regional support for Network members.&nbsp;


This is a collaboration between the ExCom, CC Community Engagement staff, and Network members. We invite applications from individuals or teams who wish to host these meetings and take the lead on building the content. Support for communications, registration and technology (including the digital meeting platform) will be provided by CC staff.


Regions are subjectively interpreted. We welcome applications that reflect a group of communities or countries. You do not need to cover an entire continent! Applicants may select their own target region, sub-region, group of countries or communities. Some examples of common ground can be sharing the same language or socio-economical and cultural vicinities. Tell us about who you are trying to reach!


A kit containing sample programming ideas will be provided to successful applicants, and we welcome your creativity in creating the content. Your event may aim to provide networking opportunities, show-and-tell of current projects, or feature ways to get involved on a more local level.&nbsp;
