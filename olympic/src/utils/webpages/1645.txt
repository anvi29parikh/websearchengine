Either way, your search stops here, at the CVU Academy!


 Introductionview


ShortcutsWP:CVUWP:VANDWAR


The Counter-Vandalism Unit (CVU) is a Wikipedia project  whose aim is to help detect and remove vandalism on Wikipedia by using tools and experience, and to provide advice on dealing with vandals. All members of the Wikipedia community can revert vandalism at any time. Active vandalism patrollers who join this project will receive occasional newsletters with information on training, software updates, and new or modified policies and guidelines.

Some active members have volunteered to train other editors in countering vandalism. If you would like to learn more about the process or if you think you would like to train others, please see the Counter-Vandalism Academy.




 Goalsview


Protect Wikipedia from disruption.
React to vandalism in progress.
Inform active counter-vandalism users on updates and new software.
Train new counter-vandals.
Study the effects of vandalism on the encyclopedia.


 Helpview




How to help:

Identify that an edit qualifies as vandalism.
Restore the page to the last non-vandalized version.
Inform the editor that the edits were perceived as vandalism.
Report the editor if vandalism persists.


 Associatesview







New Pages Patrol —  review New Pages to detect copyright violations, vandalism, attack pages, hoaxes and spam, making minor improvements, and listing inappropriate pages for deletion.



ClueBot NG — a bot that uses a vandalism-detection algorithm to automatically revert most vandalism.



Recent Changes Patrol — users who regularly patrol Recent Changes in real time and, among other things, remove vandalism. 




Counter Vandalism Network (CVN) — recent changes broadcasted live on IRC channel #cvn-wp-en connect with information on how likely the edit is to be vandalism.



 Recognitionview











The Anti-Vandalism Barnstar 


may be awarded to those who show great contributions to protecting and reverting attacks of vandalism on Wikipedia. Use barnstars sparingly – don't  dilute their importance.





The Silver CVU Award


is awarded to those who make significant contributions to The Counter-Vandalism Unit or to counter-vandalism.





The Gold CVU Award


is awarded for outstanding contributions to The Counter-Vandalism Unit or to counter-vandalism where the Silver CVU Award would be insufficient.
