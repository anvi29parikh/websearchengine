Thanks to the CC Global Network Community Activities Fund, our Chapter was able to launch a Legal Clinic on Media &amp; The Arts in Digital Environment, aimed at providing legal analysis and advice to independent creators, but also to start-ups in media and digital arts and organizations of stakeholders in the creative industries.
The clinic engages students from law faculties and specialized Intellectual Property programs in giving pro-bono legal advice to independent artists, musicians, designers, and independent producers, while encouraging application of CC licenses, advertising the values of “openness”, and educating the community on IP issues.

The Community Activities Fund really helped us to be awesome. We hosted a great seminar and volunteers from multiple open communities gave talks there and distributed some promotional materials among the participants. CC Chapter Bangladesh




Thanks to the Fund, CC Tanzania was able to train school pupils and young lawyers on the benefits of Creative Commons Licenses, as well as on being creative, active and proactive in sharing knowledge and resources. Both the school group as well as the young lawyers established CC Clubs which are still active today and involved in CC Tanzania’s work. CC Chapter Tanzania
