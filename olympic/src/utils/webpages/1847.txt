Redirect to:Wikipedia:Subpages This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect:

From a modification: This is a redirect from a modification of the target's title or a closely related title.  For example, the words may be rearranged.
Please note that there are many more specific templates. Please use {{R from alternative spelling}} for spelling changes (including punctuation and spacing); see subcategories of Category:Redirects from modifications for other options (capitals, abbreviations, diacritics, plurals, stylizations, transliteration, ligatures, different parts of speech, etc.). If you are unsure which to use, this template is fine; someone will make it more specific later if necessary.
In cases of modification from distinctly longer or shorter names, please use {{R from long name}} or {{R from short name}}, respectively. An abbreviation should be tagged with {{R from initialism}} or, if it can be spoken like a word such as NASA and RADAR, use {{R from acronym}}.
Use this rcat instead of {{R from other capitalisation}} and {{R from plural}} in namespaces other than mainspace for those types of modification. This may also apply to several other subcategories of modification; please check those templates' output before saving if using outside of mainspace.


To a project page: This is a redirect from any page inside or outside of project (Wikipedia: or WP:) space to any page in the project namespace. The above category link leads to a list of redirects from inside project space.  Redirects from outside project space are automatically sorted to Category:Redirects to project space.


From a shortcut: This is a redirect from a shortcut in any namespace to a page in any namespace except template namespace.
Shortcuts are wikilinked on community pages, talk pages, and edit summaries, but not in mainspace articles.

When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
