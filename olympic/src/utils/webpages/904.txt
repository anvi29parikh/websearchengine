Serving as a catalyst for collaboration between all members of the Olympic family, from the National Olympic Committees (NOCs), the International Sports Federations (IFs), the athletes, the Organising Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs), to the TOP Partners, broadcast partners and United Nations agencies, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) shepherds success through a wide range of programmes and projects.


 On this basis, it ensures the regular celebration of the Olympic Games, supports all affiliated member organisations of the Olympic Movement and strongly encourages, by appropriate means, the promotion of the Olympic values. It is governed according to a high standard of ethical rules.
Mission


The mission of the IOC is to promote Olympism and to lead the Olympic Movement. According to the Olympic Charter, the roles of the administration are the:

    organisation and preparation of other Olympic events;
    circulation of information within the Olympic Movement;
    advice to Interested Parties;
    relations with many international governmental and non-governmental organisations dealing with, in particular, sport, education and culture;
    liaison with Olympic Solidarity and implementation of many other tasks of an ongoing or ad hoc nature assigned to it by the President and the Executive Board.
