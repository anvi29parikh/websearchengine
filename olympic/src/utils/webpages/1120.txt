Tasks[edit]
Clarify the distinction between RONR and other Robert's Rules of Order versions (active current dispute on the Robert's Rules talk page) Sakuranohi (talk) 03:44, 5 May 2018 (UTC)
Add more non-RONR material to pages that are primarily RONR
Expand articles on motions:
cite other PA beside RONR
legislative procedure
meeting procedures in other countries (or rename Articles to US parliamentary procedure because 90% of what this project writes is country-specific with no explicit mention of that fact)
Create and expand articles on parliamentary terms and concepts
Expand stub pages to start page assessment
Ensure that every article is cited; no article should be without at least one reference
Develop editing guidelines for Parliamentary Procedure articles (add to this project page)
Add book citations to Bibliography of Parliamentary Procedure
Stubs[edit]
None currently identified
Pages needing attention[edit]
Majority, absolute majority, and simple majority - should we merge these to more clearly compare and contrast the related concepts on one page?
Guidelines[edit]
Motion Articles[edit]
[lead paragraph - briefly defining motion]
Explanation and Use
Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised  (RONR)


- Note that the linked article is Robert's Rules of Order, but the link text says RONR. They are not the same, but the article claims that they are. RONR should have its own article.

The Standard Code (TSC)
[Other Parliamentary Authorities (PA)]
Legislative Use
History
Related Motions and Concepts
PA Citations[edit]
Use these abbreviations only after the full title has been included on the page
RONR - Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised
TSC - The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure
Demeter's Manual (1969) is the 'Blue Book' edition.

DEM, MAS, RID are abbreviations used in Template:Cite parl only, not in article text
