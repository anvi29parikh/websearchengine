Get Set Injury Prevention App – Train smarter


Injuries are far too common in many sports. For an athlete, being injured can be devastating and even end a promising career. However, injuries can be prevented. Numerous scientific studies have proven that structured warm-up exercises can reduce the risk of injuries by over 50%!


Get Set – Train smarter was created to coincide with the 2014 and 2016 Youth Olympic Games in Nanjing, China and in Lillehammer, Norway, and is the result of a collaboration between the International Olympic Committee, the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center, and several international sports federations.

The target group is not only young talents and their coaches, but anyone engaged in physical activity. Get Set was created to help prevent sports injuries by providing the most effective and evidence-based workout routines for your needs.


All exercises are presented through videos, supported by short descriptions on how to perform the exercise correctly. Exercises are presented with variations as well as three levels to make them more difficult and challenging as you progress.
