Sport has long been recognised as a major contributor to positive health and well-being for participants; however, as a microcosm of society, sport is not immune from wider societal ills. 


The IOC firmly believes that harassment and abuse have no place in sport or in society, and advocates for safe sport, as the safety and wellbeing of athletes are paramount.


Sport is global, crossing cultures and laws, but there is only one culture that must apply: the culture of respect.


Since 2004, the IOC has been developing programmes and initiatives to safeguard athletes from harassment and abuse in sport. 
Commissions


The IOC prevention of harassment and abuse in sport (PHAS) initiatives have been established by the following four IOC Commissions:


Athletes’ Commission


Athletes’ Entourage Commission


Medical and Scientific Commission


Women in Sport Commission


These IOC Commissions are represented on the IOC Prevention of Harassment and Abuse in Sport (PHAS) Working Group, which is chaired by HRH Prince Feisal Al-Hussein. The IOC PHAS Working Group collaborates with subject matter experts and Olympic Movement stakeholders to develop and implement initiatives to safeguard athletes from harassment and abuse in sport. 

        
    

    
        

            
We must be more determined than ever to protect athletes. One case is one case too many. Together we can make a difference

Safeguarding: Measures and initiatives which are put in place to PREVENT harassment and abuse









What is the basis for the IOC PHAS initiatives?


The safeguarding of athletes is embedded in the overarching fundamental principles of Olympism found in the Olympic Charter, as well as other foundational documents of the Olympic Movement, including:
