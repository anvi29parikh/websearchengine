Redirect to:Template:Redirect category shell This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect:

Template-protected: This is a redirect from a page that is template-protected from editing for any of several possible reasons. Only administrators and template editors may edit this page.
Please do not replace these redirected links with links directly to the target page unless expressly advised to do so below or elsewhere on this page, or if the change is supported by a policy or guideline.


From a high-use template: This is a redirect from a highly-transcluded redirect to a template.
This template is used on approximately 138,000 pages.
 To avoid major disruption and server load, any changes should be tested in the template's /sandbox or /testcases subpages, or in your own user subpage. The tested changes can be added to this page in a single edit. Consider discussing changes on the talk page before implementing them.


To a redirect category (rcat) template: This is a redirect from an alias/shortcut (usually), or from a redirect that is the result of a page move/rename, to a redirect category (rcat) template.


From a template shortcut: This is a redirect from a shortcut page name in any namespace to a page in template namespace.
Shortcuts are wikilinked on community pages, talk pages, and edit summaries, but not in mainspace articles. Transclusions in mainspace are common and do not need to be "fixed".

When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
