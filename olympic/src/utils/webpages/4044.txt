Welcome to WikiProject Edit requests. We aim to reform the process of edit requests and assist in the process of making edit requests, as well as responding to them. If you would like to help, please add yourself as a participant in the project, inquire on the talk page, and see the to-do list, below.

Goals[edit]


Currently, making edit requests is a technical process, something not ideal for new users, which are often the ones creating edit requests. Additionally, there is inconsistency in how edit requests are reviewed and under what circumstances an edit request should be declined. Our WikiProject aims to clear up these points of confusion and in general make the process of writing an edit request as easy as possible.
