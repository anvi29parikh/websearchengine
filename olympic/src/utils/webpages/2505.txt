I'm Dibbydib, and this is Wikipedia. There's nothing I feel obligated to fill in here the userboxes haven't already done.


This is the paragraph where I talk about what I do in Wikipedia. Most userpages have these, and they're pretty similar to each other. I never read these lines of text anyway, so I bet I fooled somebody into thinking there's an ordinary paragraph here. I'm just trying to make it look like my userpage isn't totally barren. My favorite page is WP:DAFT.


Anyway, here's some links I use. Have fun.
