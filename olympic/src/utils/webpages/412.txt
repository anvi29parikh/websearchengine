Airbnb is helping to create a new standard for hosting that will be a win for host cities, a win for spectators and fans, and a win for athletes.


Exclusive category: Unique Accommodation Products, Unique Experiences Services and Olympian Experiences Services


Since becoming a Worldwide Olympic Partner in 2019, Airbnb has committed to providing travel options that are economically empowering, socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. This includes accommodation provisions that will reduce costs for Olympic Games organisers and stakeholders, minimise the need for construction of new accommodation infrastructure for the Olympic Games period, and generate direct revenue for local hosts and communities. Working together with the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), Airbnb will also promote accommodation that supports accessibility for people with disabilities or other accessibility needs.


Airbnb Olympian Experiences


The IOC and Airbnb will launch Airbnb Olympian Experiences to provide direct earning opportunities for athletes, underlining the IOCâs efforts to support athletes and put them at the heart of the Olympic Movement. This new category will bring Airbnbâs goal of providing economic empowerment through hosting to athletes across the globe â beyond the timeframe and geographical location of the Games. Promoting sport and physical activity, these experiences will include everything from the chance to train with an Olympian to exploring a city with an elite athlete. Airbnb and the IOC, through the IOC Athlete365 platform, will provide support and training to athletes interested in becoming a host on the Airbnb Experiences platform.



As a global Partner, Airbnb will support the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022, the Olympic Games Paris 2024, the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026 and the Olympic Games Los Angeles 2028.



About Airbnb



Airbnb is one of the worldâs largest marketplaces for unique, authentic places to stay and things to do, offering over 7 million accommodation options and 40,000 activities, all powered by local hosts.
