Considering the above objective, the IOC and IPC fully respect the principles established by Beijing 2022.


These principles are based on wide-ranging consultations with international experts and the Chinese authorities, as well as the experience of Olympic and Paralympic stakeholders.


The principles presented by Beijing 2022 will be detailed in the Playbooks. The first version of these Playbooks will be released in late October. A second version will then be published in December.

    
    

Vaccination policy
    
    
        
        

All athletes and Games participants who are fully vaccinated will enter the closed-loop management system upon arrival. Games participants who are not fully vaccinated will have to serve a 21-day quarantine upon arrival in Beijing. 
        
        
        

Athletes who can provide a justified medical exemption will have their cases considered. 
        
        
        

All vaccines recognised by WHO or related international organisations, or approved officially by the countries or regions concerned, will be accepted.
        
    
    
    
    

Games-time closed-loop management 
    
    
        
        

From 23 January until the end of the Paralympics, a closed-loop management system will be implemented to ensure the safe delivery of the Games. This closed-loop management system will cover all Games-related areas, including arrival and departure, transport, accommodation, catering, competitions, and the Opening and Closing Ceremonies. Within the closed loop, participants will be allowed to move only between Games-related venues for training, competitions and work. A dedicated Games transport system will be put in place. 
        
    
    
    
    

Spectators/Ticketing
    
    
        
        

Tickets will be sold exclusively to spectators residing in Chinaâs mainland, who meet the requirements of the COVID-19 countermeasures.
        
        
        

Specific requirements on COVID-19 countermeasures for spectators from Chinaâs mainland and the details of ticketing arrangements are under discussion and development, and will be released to the public in due course once they are finalised. 
        
    
    
    
    

Accredited guest policy 
    
    
        
        

Beijing 2022 and the IOC underlined that all activities are being assessed and optimised to focus on essential aspects of Games delivery. Stakeholders will apply this principle for their plans and delegation composition.
        
        
        

In line with this principle, the IOC EB decided to cancel the accompanying guest category for all stakeholders.
        
    
    
    
    

Travel
    
    
        
        

Beijing 2022 will assist those stakeholders that are not in a position to book their pre-Games or Games-time flights independently.
        
    
    
    
    

Accommodation
    
    
        
        

Besides athletes and some delegation officials who are accompanying athletes living in the Villages, all participants travelling to Beijing will reside in Beijing 2022-contracted hotels that will be compliant with the COVID-19 countermeasures for the Games.
        
    
    
    
    

Testing
    
    
        
        

All domestic and international Games participants and workforce in the closed-loop management system will be subject to daily testing.
        
    
    



The IOC and IPC welcome the decision to allow for the sale of tickets to spectators residing in Chinaâs mainland. This will facilitate the growth of winter sports in China by giving those spectators a first-hand Olympic and Paralympic experience of elite winter sports, as well as bringing a favourable atmosphere to the venues.&nbsp; However, all parties feel for the athletes and the spectators from around the world, knowing that the restriction on spectators from outside mainland China had to be put in place in order to ensure the safe holding of the Games this winter.


Further information about the implementation of these policies and additional information about COVID-19 countermeasures will be detailed in the Playbooks, which will be released in late October and December.


The Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 will take place between 4 and 20 February, while the Paralympic Winter Games will be held from 4 until 13 March.
