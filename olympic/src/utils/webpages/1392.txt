This page contains some useful information related to AfC submissions.


There are currently 2,263 pending submissions which are awaiting review.
You can find the articles to be reviewed, oldest first &gt;here&lt; or review from the sortable list below.


Please check also the page Pending AfC submissions in article space if an inexperienced editor (or an experienced editor, by accident) moved an AfC submission incorrectly into the main space.

Sorted topic-wise lists


The topic-wise lists are based on draft topics predicted using machine learning. The landing page lists all submissions split into sections by topic. There are also subpages for each topic which have wikitables sortable by date of submission, date of creation, number of past declines, etc. ORES quality assessment and possible spam/vandalism alerts are also included. These lists are updated by a bot daily at UTC midnight.

This chart is compiled by an automated bot, EarwigBot&nbsp;(talk&nbsp;· contribs), and displays statistics about the most recent Articles for Creation submissions in an easy-to-view format. The chart is automatically updated every hour. Please direct any questions about the information the bot compiles to the operator's talk page.

Because of the high backlog, the sorted list can only be displayed on its template page:View full list of AfC submissionsWhen the backlog is high, the table will not display and a link will be shown instead.  Click on the link to view the table. This is a limitation of the Wikipedia software.
