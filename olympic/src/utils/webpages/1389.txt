Welcome to WikiProject Articles for Creation! This is the project page for editors interested in working on Articles for creation, Redirects and Categories for creation and Files for upload.

If you would like to submit an article to Wikipedia, please use the Article wizard; alternatively, for redirects and categories, please use the Redirect wizard or Category wizard. If you would like to request a media file be uploaded to Wikipedia, please use the File upload wizard. If you simply wanted to suggest an article for someone else to write, please go to Requested articles.
Introduction


Currently, only autoconfirmed registered users are allowed to create articles on Wikipedia. Often, an unregistered user would like to create an article but does not want to register in order to do so. We do not judge an editor who does not want to register, and AfC is a process by which their contributions can become Wikipedia articles. AfC is also the only accepted way for an editor with a conflict of interest to write articles about subjects they are associated with, or paid to write.


AfC works as a peer review process, where autoconfirmed users either accept and create an article submitted by an anonymous editor or decline the article because it is unsuitable for Wikipedia.


An article may be unsuitable for Wikipedia for a number of reasons. AfC submissions can be declined based on having no content whatsoever, consisting of vandalism or personal attacks, consisting of copyrighted material, failing to provide sufficient context, not asserting notability, and most often for not being properly sourced. Articles that already exist, sometimes under another name, are also declined.


A lot of articles are posted at AfC and a dedicated team of editors is needed to review the requests. AfC was once Wikipedia's oldest backlogged project, with incomplete archive pages over two years old. Through the work of this WikiProject, this backlog was eliminated on 21 February 2008 during a project-wide drive. Continuing efforts ensure that the backlog does not return.

Brief history


On 5 December 2005, in response to the Seigenthaler incident, unregistered users were stopped from creating new pages on the English Wikipedia (read about it in the Signpost).


Consequently, the page Wikipedia:Articles for creation was set up by Creidieki&nbsp;(talk&nbsp;· contribs) and others, to allow unregistered users to submit articles for registered users to create on their behalf. The first page to be created was the redirect Fox Latin America requested by 140.247.23.58 (talk&nbsp;· contribs&nbsp;· WHOIS). The first article created was Horsea Island by Chemstud&nbsp;(talk&nbsp;· contribs).


Following huge backlogs on the page, Kwsn and others started WikiProject Articles for creation on 2 June 2007.

Welcome template


This template is used to welcome new participants to the project. It can be added to a new participant's talk page by adding {{subst:AfC welcome}} to the bottom of the page:





Hi, and welcome to WikiProject Articles for creation! We are a group of editors who work together on the Articles for creation and Files for upload pages.


A few tips that you might find helpful:

Please take time to fully read the reviewers' instructions before reviewing submissions.
The reviewers' talk page is the best place to ask for help or advice. You might like to watchlist this page, and you are encouraged to take part in any discussion that comes up.
Article submissions that need reviewing can be found in Category:Pending AfC submissions and there is also a useful list which is maintained by a bot.
You might wish to add {{AFC status}} or {{AfC Defcon}} to your userpage, which will alert you to the number of open submissions. There is also a project userbox. If you haven't done so already, please consider adding your name to the list of participants.
Several of our members monitor Wikipedia's help IRC channel, and you are welcome to join in to ask Wikipedia-related questions.
The IRC channel #wikipedia-en-afc connect is used occasionally for internal discussion regarding the Articles for creation process, and also serves as a recent changes feed, displaying all edits made in the Articles for creation namespace.
The help desk is the place where new editors can ask questions about their submissions. You are welcome to help in answering their questions.


Once again, welcome to the project. ~~~~
