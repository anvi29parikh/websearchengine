This WikiProject aims primarily to provide information on all protected areas (abbreviated on this page as PAs) in the world. 


The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)[1] defines a protected area as:



"An area of land and/or sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means." 


National parks are probably the best-known PAs, but there are many other categories. Protected areas are those which a higher level governmental entity manages, maintains and or oversees directly. For instance in the United States, this would include primarily federal and to a lesser degree, state managed areas, but rarely those managed by a county or city.

Open tasks[edit]


Below are some suggested open tasks for Wikipedians looking to contribute.

Create stubs (including the protected area infobox) for missing articles that may be mentioned in Talk page or listed here.
Stubs should be created from the existing World Database of Protected Areas stewarded by the World Conservation Monitoring Center.
List of national parks in Africa
List of national parks of China
List of U.S. Wilderness Areas
List of national parks of Venezuela
Add infobox to, or upgrade to current template, articles in:
List of Canadian national parks (needs map similar to Australia, New Zealand, and U.S.)
List of areas in the National Park System of the United States (all National Parks and National Memorials are done)
List of U.S. National Forests
List of National Wildlife Refuges
United States National Marine Sanctuary
List of U.S. Wilderness Areas
National Estuarine Research Reserve
Create a full List of National Landscape Conservation System areas
Expand stub articles from Category:Protected area stubs
Create navigation box templates similar to {{National parks of the United States}} and {{National Historical Parks of the United States}} (including the clickable map) for each classification of US Park (Monuments, Memorials, etc.).

Cleanup[edit]
Cleanup listing (current)
Cleanup listing by WolterBot (last updated March 2010)
Structure[edit]


There shall be a List of Conservation topics which lists the various topics on conservation.  (This probably does not belong here...)


There shall be four article levels in this WikiProject:

Level 1: An article called "Protected area" shall discuss PAs in general, as opposed to any particular PA. Since a PA is almost always associated with one country, it will provide an alphabetical list (with links) of countries that have PAs. An extra item "International Protected Areas" will be added to the list for PAs that are shared by two or more countries.

Level 2: These articles shall discuss a particular country's PAs in general. It shall have an alphabetical list of PA types (such as National Park, Wildlife Sanctuary, ... / no links) which exist in that country, followed by a description. For each type (or combination of types) the existing PAs will be listed alphabetically (with links). For a PA that lies in a dependent territory of that country a mention shall be made of that territory.

Level 3: In countries where all or part of the PAs are not managed on a country level the level 2 articles will contain an alphabetical list of the states/provinces/... (with links) that manage the PAs. The links to which they point shall be the level 3 articles. They shall have the same structure as the level 2 articles.

Level 4: These shall be the actual PA articles.
Formatting[edit]
Formatting of the level 1 article (Protected area)[edit]
A general description;
A list of countries that have PAs (with links in the "Protected areas of X" format);
A link to the page "International protected areas".
Formatting of level 2 articles[edit]
A general description;
A list of PA types with a short explanation;
A list of PA's per PA type;
A list of states/provinces/... for PA' which are managed on that level (with links in the "Protected areas of X" format).
A link to the level 1 article and (an) external link(s), if available.


For test articles see: Protected areas of Australia, Protected areas of the United States

Formatting of level 3 articles[edit]
A general description;
A list of PA types with a short explanation (if that explanation differs from the explanation given on country level);
A list of PA's per PA type.
A link to the corresponding level 2 article and (an) external link(s), if available.


For a test article see: Protected areas of the Australian Capital Territory

Formatting of level 4 articles[edit]
A description. This should contain the PAs location ([state/province/...] (where applicable), [country name], [distance and direction from (a) major or well known city/cities], [date established], [area size], and its main features/points of interest. If available, one or more photos can be included;
A template containing:
The PA's name;
IUCN Category;
A map locator;
Its location ([state/province/...], country);
The nearest major or well known city;
The PA's area (km², if acres, provide km² in parenthesis); Use {{Convert}}.
Its latitude and longitude (major feature, main visitor center if within PA, or center);
The date of establishment;
The yearly visitation (and year the number is from) if available
The governing body/bodies;
A link to the corresponding level 3 article and (an) external link(s), if available.


Note: depending on the IUCN category a different colour background is used.


For test articles see: Bob Marshall Wilderness
Yellowstone National Park

Note[edit]
Disambiguation pages are probably the best solution if there are PAs of the same type and with the same name in different countries/states/provinces/etc. Example: Glacier National Park
Protected areas infobox[edit]
Infobox, showing the Infobox template, use practices and explanations.
Project messages[edit]
