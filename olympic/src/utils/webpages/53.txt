Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUE) applications


The IOC has delegated responsibility for all TUE applications to the International Testing Agency (ITA). This means that the ITA is now fully responsible for the TUE application process for all athletes that fall under the IOC’s jurisdiction.


All TUE applications now need to be directed to the ITA. Further information can be found linked&nbsp;here, with the TUE application form linked&nbsp;here.
