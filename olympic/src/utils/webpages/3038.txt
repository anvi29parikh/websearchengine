Assessment request for Louis de Bonald[edit]


Louis de Bonald&nbsp;(edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs)

I've been trying to improve the article on Louis de Bonald. Before I got to it the article was in fairly bad shape, especially for a thinker who should be more appreciated by contemporary conservatives.


In summary I added much more information about his life, and added more information about his ideas. I used for my sources "Critics of the Enlightenment" by Christopher Blum and "The Historical Thought of the Vicomete de Bonald" by Mary Hall Quinlan. I also re-edited the text so that his life now reads in chronological order; before I got there much of the information wasn't even really in a coherent timeline. Also added the pictures so the article looks a bit nicer. I also added a few names to his "influences" and "influenced". I think the page looks much nicer and more developed since I've given it a good go over. There are a few sentences I think could user some clarification, and I would also appreciate if there's anything else I should add or go over. I haven't really been editing wikipedia all that long and would appreciate a more trained eye's assessment.
