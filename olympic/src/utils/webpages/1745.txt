#ArticleAlerts




ShortcutWP:AALERTS Article alerts is a subscription-based automatic article-monitoring system used to give "status reports" to subscribing WikiProjects. The reports are created and delivered by AAlertBot, operated by both Hellknowz (who also is the sole coder of the bot) and Headbomb.


For notification about cleanup tags, such as {{no footnotes}} and {{disputed}}, see cleanup listings.
For notification about recently created articles that could be of interest to your project, see InceptionBot.




Search Article Alerts for specific topics that interest you. If you find one, add it to your watchlist! You can also browse the subscription list.









Article Alerts is an automated subscription-based news delivery system designed to notify WikiProjects and Taskforces when articles tagged by their banners or placed in their categories enter various formal workflows (such as Articles for Deletion, Requests for Comments, Peer Review, and many more).


First AAlertBot browses all the workflows in its scope, then checks for WikiProject templates/categories on these pages. If a subscribing WikiProject/Taskforce is found, AAlertBot will update a customized report called Article Alerts for that particular WikiProject or Taskforce. (An example of such a report can be found here.) Reports are updated on a daily basis, and provide brief summaries of what is happening, with relevant links to discussion or results when possible. So it is a good idea to request for a bot to place your WikiProject/Taskforce's banner on articles from relevant categories, so AAlertBot covers more articles. (See also Tips and Tricks.)


Originally, the Article Alerts relied on ArticleAlertbot (coded and updated by B. Wolterding, operated by Legoktm) from September 2008 to April 2010 (see bot approval). Following several months of downtime, a new bot AAlertBot was developed (coded, maintained, and operated by Hellknowz, and co-operated by Headbomb) from December 2010 onwards (see bot approval).


Report issues and problems with the Article Alerts reports on the bug reports page. Requests for new features should be made at the feature requests page.

News request[edit]
Main page: Wikipedia talk:Article alerts/News
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Note: the news requests are not currently implemented.
If something is happening that you think WikiProjects should know about, then let us know and we'll include it in the articles.
Bug reports[edit]
Main page: Wikipedia talk:Article alerts/Bugs
Please report bugs, missed articles, and any other mishaps on the bug report page. Don't think someone else will do it, because that someone else might think you'll do it, and then neither of you will have reported the bug. It is also possible that the error is specific to your project, so you might be the only one to have seen this error.
Feature requests[edit]
Main page: Wikipedia talk:Article alerts/Feature requests
Have an idea that you think would improve the reports? Share it with us, and we'll see what we can do about it.
Feedback and questions[edit]
Main page: Wikipedia talk:Article alerts
Having troubles setting up Article alerts? Leave a message on our talk page, and we'll try to help as best we can.
Think Article Alerts is the greatest thing since sliced bread? Think it sucks because it doesn't actually cover Featured deletions? Let us know.
Tips and tricks[edit]
Remember to watch your project's Article Alerts pages.
Did you know that you can monitor your project's Article Alerts using RSS and Atom feeds? Go on your project's /Article alerts history page, and there should be a " RSS  Atom" in your toolbox located on the left of the page.
You can incorporate Article Alerts in navboxes for the users of your WikiProjects (see {{Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics/Member Navbox}} for example).
If a related WikiProject is also subscribed to Article Alerts, you can transclude their report on your Project's homepage, and monitor their articles too.
Request a bot to place your WikiProject's banner on the articles located in categories relevant to your WikiProject. You will probably end up with some unrelated pages, but at least you've extended Article Alerts to cover many articles you might have missed.
InceptionBot (previously AlexNewArtBot) is a bot which produces a list of recently created articles that could be in your project's scope. Going through the list to do some tagging will ensure that ArticleAlertbot picks up these articles as well.
Consider subscribing to cleanup listings to see articles that need cleanup (covers cleanup tags, such as {{expert needed}}, {{POV}}, {{page numbers needed}}, etc.)
