The XIII Olympic Congress, entitled “The Olympic Movement in society”, was held from 3 to 5 October 2009 in Copenhagen (Denmark) and brought together more than one thousand participants.


The Congress provided a rare opportunity for the entire Olympic Family (i.e. IOC members, representatives of National Olympic Committee (NOCs), International Federations (IFs), the Organising Committees of the Olympic Games (OCOGS), athletes, coaches, media, sponsors and other stakeholders)&nbsp; to meet and discuss issues of importance to the entire Movement.


In his keynote speech to the Congress, UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon paid tribute to the excellent collaboration between the United Nations (UN) and the IOC. (The IOC was granted UN observer status at the end of 2009).


In his concluding remarks, he declared: “If you asked me to jog around this conference room, I would probably run out of breath. But when it comes to fighting for our shared global goals – for a world that is cleaner, healthier, more peaceful and more prosperous – I will sprint like an Olympian. I will ski the steepest trail. I will run and run and never stop until we reach the first line. I am counting on all of you to join me. We must go for the gold.”


Over the course of the three day Congress, participants heard from many respected speakers and had interesting discussions on the following themes: 

    the Athletes
    the Olympic Games
    the Structure of the Olympic Movement
    Olympism and Youth and
    the Digital Revolution.



Each of these themes was further subdivided into three subthemes.


A half day was devoted to the discussions of each of the five themes at the Congress. The plenary sessions were followed by three simultaneous breakout sessions on the respective subthemes. (The texts of the speeches can be found under the relevant themes).


All the sessions were livecast over the internet to allow the general public to hear the discussions as they happened. (The videos of the plenary and discussion sessions of each theme can be found under the related tabs).


The breakout session on each of the subthemes began with presentations from a panel of speakers. The moderators of each panel were then responsible for the ensuing discussion period, which gave participants the opportunity to voice their opinions on the issues. The main points from each breakout session were carefully recorded by rapporteurs who informed the Editorial Committee of the discussions at the end of each day. The final document reflects the main ideas to come out of the proceedings in Copenhagen as well as information collected through the Virtual Olympic Congress. &nbsp;The Virtual Olympic Congress allowed the Olympic Family and the public to submit written contributions on the five themes during the preparatory phase. &nbsp;


The XIII Olympic Congress was a great success and has left the Olympic Movement with a blue print for the future. It is now time to translate words into action and implement the 66 recommendations. (See below for a PDF version of the recommendations)

Olympic medallist and IOC member Frank Fredericks set the tone for the first theme, “The Athletes”, by illustrating the power of sport with a personal example. “Sport changed my life. What I am today is because of what sport has given me. What I have built, what I have discovered, what I have achieved is thanks to sport” he said. “We have a responsibility to the younger generation to let them know that taking part in sport is a wonderful life experience”, he continued.


As IOC President Jacques Rogge declared, “this Olympic Congress will go down in history as that of young people and the athletes!” In his view, the number one priority for the whole Olympic Movement should be to defend the interests of young people and athletes.


The 66 recommendations from the Olympic Congress include proposals to better protect the physical and mental health of the athletes, to ensure their safety and to help them prepare for their career transition. The delegates also called for the creation of a commission to address issues pertaining to coaches, trainers and members of the athletes’ entourage.

In his keynote speech on this theme Jean-Claude Killy, Olympic medallist and IOC member, noted that, “Every two years, alternately in summer and in winter, a very large part of the world lives and breathes the Games. The Olympic Games are a passage between before and after; they are a reference to which everyone can attach memories and emotions, whatever the political, economic or cultural context. The Games bring out heroes, joys and dramas, which break into our collective memory and the universal memory.”


During the discussion sessions, delegates stressed the importance of keeping respect for the fundamental principles of Olympism at the heart of the Games.



They also focused on the need for a periodic adjustment and review of the sports programme and the importance of fully integrating new values such as the environment, sustainable development and social responsibility through the Olympic ideals.

Keynote speaker Thomas Bach, made an appeal for the protection of the autonomy of sport. The IOC Vice-President and President of the German Olympic Committee pointed out that sports organisations constantly have to deal with threats to their autonomy.y

He warned Congress delegates that these attacks come “in many different forms.” “I am sure that subsequent speakers will provide a whole host of examples from the perspective of National Olympic Committees, International Federations or painful personal experiences. You will hear about governments' attempts to prevent elections, to appoint presidents of sports organisations themselves and to manipulate voting. Many of you in this room have even suffered personally with your families. You deserve tremendous respect and gratitude for your commitment to the autonomy and values of sport” he continued to say.


In his speech Thomas Bach spoke about his own experiences with political interference in sport. As an Olympic fencing gold medallist at the 1976 Games in Montreal, he was unable to take part in the following edition of the Games because of the partial boycott of the 1980 Games in Moscow. For him, sport deserves its autonomy because of its unique role in society.


As he argued, “Sport is the only social sector that has actually achieved what political philosophy calls “global law” and what moral philosophy calls “global ethos”. The rules of sport, based on the principle of fair play, apply to every athlete all over the world. These rules can only be enforced by an autonomous sporting structure, which also created them. They help to protect fair competition and promote the competitiveness of athletes and federations.”

Inactivity is “a problem that threatens to become as urgent and critical as that of global warming or poverty.”


This was the message of keynote speaker José Manuel Ramos Horta, President of Timor-Leste and Nobel Peace Prize winner. He described this inactivity as a serious and growing threat to world health, quoting figures from a study by the World Health Organisation (WHO), which shows that sedentarity is one of the main risk factors for cardiac related problems and other non-transmissible diseases such as strokes, diabetes, cancer and asthma. The WHO study showed that, in 2004, non-transmissible diseases accounted for 60 per cent of deaths in the world. The Congress recommended that measures be taken to combat this inactivity, particularly among young people.


The Congress recommended closer cooperation between governments and sports organisations and that governments build more sports facilities as well as allocate more time for sports activities in schools, “at all ages and at all levels”.


The Congress described the Youth Olympic Games as “a unique opportunity in the history of the modern Olympic Movement to raise the bar worldwide in terms of the delivery of educational and sport programmes for all young people”.

The digital revolution


Keynote speaker Martin Sorrell, CEO of the WPP Group urged the delegates at the XIII Olympic Congress to use digital technology to reach out to young people across the world. He explained the huge impact of mobile communications technology and called on the Olympic Movement to promote Olympic values in a dynamic and attractive way.


Martin Sorrell believed that the Olympic Movement should remain true to its values and look for new ways to share them with young people. His solution was simple, “Let the children play”. Additionally, Sorrell recommended giving “content to youth in formats they want – short and fast, customisable and easy to share” as well as extending “the franchise through music and cultural partnerships to leverage fresh support and momentum, and learn from today’s successful reality television shows.” He also recommended better utilising the new generation of sporting heroes such as Usain Bolt to make the Olympic Games more attractive to young people.


For their part, delegates recommended creating a Ditigal Task Force to help National Olympic Committees, International Federations and other Olympic bodies to promote Olympic values and sports practice through new media and digital technology. They also acknowledged the “digital divide” and advised the Olympic Movement to broaden access to technology.
