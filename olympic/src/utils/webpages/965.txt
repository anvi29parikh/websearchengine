Requests for page protection



ShortcutsWP:RFPPWP:RFPWP:RPP


This page is for requesting that a page, file or template be protected. Please read up on the protection policy. Full protection is used to stop edit warring between multiple users or to prevent vandalism to high-risk templates; semi-protection and pending changes are usually used only to prevent IP and new user vandalism (see the rough guide to semi-protection); and move protection is used to stop pagemove revert wars. Extended confirmed protection is used where semi-protection has proved insufficient (see the rough guide to extended confirmed protection)


After a page has been protected, the protection is listed in the page history and logs with a short description indicating why it was protected, and the article is listed on Special:Protectedpages. Further discussion should take place on the Talk page of the article. In the case of full protection due to edit warring, admins do not revert to specific versions of the page, except to get rid of obvious vandalism.


Note: Editors should not consider requesting page protection as a method for continuing an argument from elsewhere nor as a venue for starting a new discussion regarding article content. If a request contains excessive argument, appears to be intended to resolve a content dispute, includes personal attacks or uncivil comments, or has any other unrelated discussion, it will be removed from this page and no action will be taken.

Temporary semi-protection: Persistent vandalism&nbsp;– Multiple IP-only edits many without summary, requesting page protection. SanAnMan (talk) 22:48, 28 November 2021 (UTC)

 Question: @SanAnMan: could you point out the persistent vandalism edits please? In the last 20 IP edits, I found about 4 which might be called disruptive, but many IPs edit constructively. Lectonar (talk) 17:46, 29 November 2021 (UTC)
@Lectonar: Apologies, request for protection should have been made due to disruptive editing, not vandalism. Mea culpa. Examples of disruptive editing include [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The tv movie only recently aired so it's a hot topic. Thx. - SanAnMan (talk) 18:03, 29 November 2021 (UTC)

Reason: Temporary semi-protection: High level of IP vandalism. See edit history. Beshogur (talk) 23:54, 28 November 2021 (UTC)

Obviously user Beshogur is the vandal this time, we already have reached concenus at the talk page, but Beshogur does not care and keep making unconstructive edits. He did not even joined the discussion. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pannonian_Avars#Iranian_language .

Atul Kumar Sharma ( writer )
Atul Kumar Sharma ( writer )&nbsp;(edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs)


Reason: many users are just commenting and judging the page unnecessarily, deciding to delete the page and always changing the additions I do on the page. I request page protection so that I can take time and update it to the level of Wikipedia asap with my time. I am responsible for the Atul Kumar Sharma page, I don't want any users to interfere and keep on judging and include it in group discussions. Aqzswxdecfrvgtb (talk) 14:38, 29 November 2021 (UTC)

I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (British series 21)&nbsp;(edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs)


Reason: There have been consistent errors with formatting and a lack of acknowledgement for edit requests. I understand that I do not have many edits myself, but I have worked on these articles for a while and I can recognise that the formatting for this specific article is inconsistent. I'd suggest you lower the protection level to only confirmed/autoconfirmed to prevent sockpuppetry. Thank you. ChefExists (talk) 18:35, 24 November 2021 (UTC)

The article was recently protected by Ponyo due to sockpuppetry. That is a powerful reason to leave the protection unchanged and Ponyo would have chosen ECP for a good reason. The edit requests concern colors to tables and frankly not many long-term editors would want to spend much time thinking about that. That may be why there has not been much response. Johnuniq (talk) 06:01, 29 November 2021 (UTC)
 Declined – No changes to the current protection level are required at this point in time. I agree. Lectonar (talk) 18:04, 29 November 2021 (UTC)

"The blood that is returned to the right atrium via the inferior vena, superior vena cava and the coronary sinus is deoxygenated (poor in oxygen). The blood is then passed into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve and then through the pulmonary valve to be pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs for re-oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide. The left atrium receives newly oxygenated blood from the lungs as well as the pulmonary vein which then goes through the bicuspid (mitral) valve into the strong left ventricle.
