Brisbane and Queensland are ready to welcome the world in 2032.

Australia has a love affair with the Olympic Games, reflected in the fact that we are one of only two countries that have sent athletes to every modern Olympic Games. Now we have Australia’s third opportunity to host the world’s greatest sporting event and we intend to build on the innovation and successes of Sydney 2000 and Melbourne 1956.

What really excites Australians is the opportunity for our children, for sport, and of course to show off our beautiful country. Fans can expect unbeatable sports experiences in 37 world-class venues, set against a backdrop of iconic beachfronts, breath-taking rural hinterland and exciting cities rich in culture and entertainment.

And Australia has a decade of major international sporting events coming here in the lead-up to the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Whether it’s the FIBA Women’s World Cup in basketball (2022), UCI Road World Championships in cycling (2022) or the FIFA Women’s World Cup in football in 2023, Australia knows how to put on a great show in a way that puts athletes first and gives fans the experience of a lifetime.

South-East Queensland is Australia’s fastest-growing region, home to friendly and culturally diverse people with a passion for sport, and offering first-class sporting facilities, excellent transport and a commitment to put the world’s athletes at the centre of everything we do.

Our Olympic family of sports, with more than nine million participants, can now plan ahead and take advantage of this ten-year “green and gold” runway that precedes the Brisbane 2032 Olympic Games. And for our First Nations people, there will be possibilities for a new generation of kids leading into 2032 and the positive impact of empowering young people now and in the period beyond. A new generation of Cathy Freemans awaits.

Brisbane is a special place. It will host a memorable and exciting Games and the world will be welcome.

We thank the Members of the International Olympic Committee for entrusting us with this great responsibility.

The Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games. History beckons.
