Every day, people from around the world come to YouTube to experience the world's biggest cultural moments. Whether hosting a live charity event, a town hall meeting or a press conference about breaking news, YouTube Live and Premieres allow creators to bring viewers together in real time to learn, discuss and form new social communities.
              
              
                

YouTube Live is an easy way for creators to reach their community in real time. Whether streaming an event, teaching a class or hosting a workshop, YouTube has tools that will help manage live streams and interact with viewers in real time.


Creators can live stream on YouTube via webcam, mobile or encoder streaming. Webcam and mobile are considered great options for beginners and allow creators to go live quickly. Encoder streaming is ideal for more advanced live streams such as: sharing the creator's screen or broadcasting gameplay, connecting to external audio and video hardware, and managing an advanced live stream production (like multiple cameras and microphones).

Premieres allows creators and their audience to watch and experience a new video together, similar to a movie or TV show premiere. Premieres lets creators schedule a video upload and create a public watch page that can be shared in advance of the Premiere.


         

Premieres: Once a Premiere is scheduled, a shareable and public watch page is created, allowing creators, artists and publishers and their viewers to watch and experience new videos together.

Moderating a channel's live chat makes our YouTube community more welcoming and healthy. YouTube offers live chat moderation tools to help prevent harassment and make everyone feel safe. Some of these tools include: assigning moderators, blocked words list, holding inappropriate chats for review, slow mode and turning off live chat. Before starting a live stream or debuting a Premiere on YouTube, we encourage everyone to familiarise themselves with our moderation tools and Community Guidelines to keep live chat positive for viewers.
              
              
                

For creators to monetise their live stream or Premiere, their channel needs to be part of the YouTube Partner Programme (YPP). Creators have several ways to earn money from live streams and Premieres: ads, Super Chat and Super Stickers, and channel memberships.


*Feature availability varies by country and we are working to expand to more countries.
