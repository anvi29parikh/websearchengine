    8,500 coaches through the Development of the National Sports System programme.



2021-2024 Key Priorities 


In line with the IOC’s own strategy for 2021-2024, the key priorities of the Olympic Solidarity 2021-2024 Plan are to further develop the NOC opportunity offer and place Olympic Solidarity as the main reference of the Olympic Movement for the development of sport. As a result, the strategic objectives of the Olympic Solidarity 2021-2024 plan are the following:  

    Empower NOCs to keep athletes at the heart of the Olympic Movement
    Ensure good governance, financial control and compliance
    Strengthen the Olympic Movement’s solidarity funding model 
    Align with the IOC’s strategy for the post-coronavirus world
    Enable NOCs to contribute to the promotion of the Olympic Values 
    Provide individualised services to NOCs 
    Measure the real impact of the Olympic Solidarity programmes and funding on the worldwide development of sport



A long history


Olympic Solidarity was created more than 50 years ago in order to assist newly independent countries, particularly in Asia and Africa, to develop their own structures to favour the expansion of sport at national level. Milestones of its rich history include:


1960 The IOC decided to set up its own assistance programme for the NOCs, with a particular focus on supporting a certain number of NOCs that had been created when their countries gained independence. 


1962 The International Olympic Aid Committee (IOAC) was created by IOC Member Count Jean de Beaumont with a view to achieving this goal. 


1971 The Committee for Olympic Solidarity was created when the IOAC merged with the International Institute for the Development of NOCs, which was founded in 1969 by the Permanent General Assembly of the NOCs. 


1973 Efforts continued with the aim of improving assistance to those NOCs in greatest need. With more than 50 new NOCs created in countries that had very few resources to develop sport in their territories in the 1960 and 1970, these efforts were of utmost importance for the development of sport. 


1979 The IOC granted 20% of revenues from television rights to the NOCs at the constitutive assembly of the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) in Puerto Rico. 


1981 The Olympic Solidarity Commission was created at the Olympic Congress in Baden-Baden by IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and ANOC President Mario Vázquez Raña. Its mission was to serve the interests and meet the needs of the NOCs. It was chaired by the IOC President.


1984 Olympic Solidarity was moved to an income management structure that met IOC criteria, rather than providing a general subsidy, a move made possible by the increase in television rights revenues beginning with the Games of the XXIII Olympiad in Los Angeles. 


1985 The Olympic Solidarity Commission started to conduct its activities on a quadrennial plan basis and to enjoy administrative independence in line with its functions, scope and structure. 


2001 The current structure of Olympic Solidarity’s programmes was established by IOC President Jacques Rogge. 


2018 The Olympic Solidarity Commission is now chaired by the IOC Member Robin E. Mitchell.


Role and responsibilities


The Olympic Solidarity Commission is responsible for defining the main course of action and managing the activities of the Olympic Solidarity international office in Lausanne. This office takes care of all operational aspects of the implementation of the programmes and cooperates with five continental offices within the Continental Associations, as well as with the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC).
