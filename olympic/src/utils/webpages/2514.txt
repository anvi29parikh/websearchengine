Mid dot[edit]


Is it really necessary to transclude a template just to get a bullet/mid dot? --kingboyk 15:03, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

AWB is removing date= parameter in references[edit]


See. Checkingfax (talk) 05:02, 18 September 2015 (UTC)

@Checkingfax: As stated in the talk header you kindly added to this page, "This is the talk page for discussing improvements to the AWB template."  Instead, I suggest you post to Wikipedia talk:AutoWikiBrowser with some explanation (e.g. Do you like this undocumented feature?  Is there a problem with the removal of this blank field?)  Thanks!  GoingBatty (talk) 23:44, 18 September 2015 (UTC)
GoingBatty, will do. The date= parameter is not deprecated and I don't agree with its removal even if empty. Having empty fields ready to go speeds up later population of the parameter, especially by novice editors. Here is the CS1 guideline on parameter deprecation. Checkingfax (talk) 23:56, 18 September 2015 (UTC)
@Checkingfax: Upon further inspection, I noticed that the reference before the AWB edit was |date=May 2004|work=State of New Jersey Commission of Investigation|author=|date=|.  One of AWB's general fixes is to remove duplicated fields.  GoingBatty (talk) 00:05, 19 September 2015 (UTC)
Thanks GoingBatty. Nice catch. Monkbot managed by Trappist the monk as seen here is clearly considering the date= parameter to be deprecated, which it is not. Checkingfax (talk) 00:28, 19 September 2015 (UTC)

Off-by-two page error[edit]
 Resolved


I'm writing up de:Momme Andresen for English Wiki. {{NDB}} is giving me a page number error - he's on pp. 286-287 in NDB, but I have to enter pp. 284-285 to get his NDB article - Carl Graf von Klinckowström&nbsp;[de] (1953), "Andresen, Momme", Neue Deutsche Biographie (in German), 1, Berlin: Duncker &amp; Humblot, pp.&nbsp;284–285CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list (link);&nbsp;(full text online). Can anyone help? Narky Blert (talk) 22:29, 13 August 2017 (UTC)

@Narky Blert: Didn't you mean to post on the {{NDB}} talk page rather than here? Rjwilmsi 07:09, 14 August 2017 (UTC)
@Rjwilmsi: I did indeed. Thank you for waking me up. Narky Blert (talk) 09:41, 14 August 2017 (UTC)
