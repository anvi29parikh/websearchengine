This week, IOC President Thomas Bach was in Copenhagen (Denmark), where he addressed the Smart Cities and Sport Summit, an annual event of the World Union of Olympic Cities, chaired by the Mayor of Lausanne, Grégoire Junod. The role of cities to promote healthy and active societies was the focus of this 2021 edition. “This Summit is an opportunity to showcase the special role that cities, and specifically Olympic cities, can play to promote healthy and active living,” said&nbsp;the IOC President in&nbsp;a keynote address to the conference. “Cities are also at the forefront when it comes to rebuilding a more human-centred and more inclusive society in the post-pandemic world.” The President also noted that “just as the pandemic has highlighted the importance of physical activity, we see that the number of people who do not do enough sport is shockingly high. […] This goes against everything that we have learned during this pandemic – and that is: sport can save lives.” Full news release here.


During a ceremony, President Bach presented the Olympic Order to Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, who became an IOC Honorary Member during the IOC Session in Tokyo. In his speech, the President underlined Prince Frederik’s passion and enthusiasm for sport, his commitment to Olympism and his attachment to the Olympic values, throughout the 12 years he was an IOC Member.&nbsp;&nbsp;He also praised him as a “strong promoter of an active lifestyle” and for his “engagement and commitment to safeguard our planet for the next generation as a member of the IOC Sustainability and Legacy Commission, as well as through the environmental projects undertaken by your Foundation.” Prince Frederik announced his resignation as an IOC Member last June in order to concentrate on his official duties in Denmark.


Speaking at the 125th anniversary celebration of the National Olympic Committee and Sports Confederation of Denmark, President Bach said that they could “look back with great pride on a long history of promoting the role of sport in Denmark”. The President also praised the work of the NOC, chaired by Hans Natorp, which “has played an indispensable role in spreading the Olympic values of excellence, friendship, respect and solidarity” across Denmark. He added: “As Denmark’s largest grassroots sport organisation, the NOC has inspired generations with sport, bringing the joy of sport to all people.”

The IOC President addressed the members of the Executive Committee of the International Fencing Federation (FIE) during their meeting at Olympic House.

In a phone conversation, President Bach and the CEO of TOP Partner Intel, Pat&nbsp;Gelsinger, discussed the excellent cooperation between their organisations and the preparations for the upcoming editions of the Olympic Games.


The IOC President remotely addressed the graduates from the Classes of 2020 and 2021 of the International Academy of Sports Science and Technology (AISTS), who were gathered at The Olympic Museum. Applauding those receiving their diploma, who included Olympians and IOC Member in Afghanistan Samira Asghari, the President congratulated them on being the first classes to complete one of most challenging Masters of Sports Administration during a global pandemic. He also praised them for showing, like the athletes at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, flexibility, determination, perseverance, resilience and solidarity, and he reminded them that they are now part of Olympic community.


On 21 November, the IOC President held a video call with three-time Olympian Peng Shuai from China. He was joined by the Chair of the IOC Athletes’ Commission, Emma Terho, and IOC Member in China Li Lingwei, who has known Peng for many years from her time in the Chinese Tennis Federation.&nbsp;At the beginning of the 30-minute call, Peng thanked the IOC for its concern about her well-being. She explained that she is safe and well, living at her home in Beijing, but would like to have her privacy respected at this time. That is why she prefers to spend her time with friends and family right now. Nevertheless, she will continue to be involved in tennis, the sport she loves so much. Read the full news release here.

IOC Member Richard W. Pound has been granted the title of “Founding President” of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), in recognition of his enormous contribution to the protection of clean sport. This title acknowledges, in particular, the part he played in WADA’s establishment in 1999 and the early years of the Agency’s existence as its first President. Pound received the honour during the WADA Foundation Board hybrid meeting in Paris (France) on 25 November. Among the many tributes paid to Pound, the IOC President said: “Richard Pound has made a great contribution for the protection of clean athletes by fighting vigorously against doping. I could experience this first-hand in my early days as an IOC Member when we were working together on what was then the Olympic Movement Anti-Doping Code, the forerunner to the World Anti-Doping Code. There, I could appreciate his strong commitment to the integrity of sports and competitions, and to the Olympic values. This clear orientation has been and still is the guiding thread in all the positions he has held, in particular as Founding President of WADA. The entire Olympic Movement owes him our gratitude for his outstanding contribution to the credibility of sport.” &nbsp;Full details here.

On 25 November, World Athletics published the findings of a study conducted during the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 to identify and address targeted, abusive messages sent to athletes via social media.
