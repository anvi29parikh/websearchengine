Redirect to:Wikipedia:Lists This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect:

From an ambiguous term: This is a redirect from an ambiguous page name to a page or list that disambiguates it. These redirects are pointed to by links that should always be disambiguated.  Therefore, this template should never appear on a page that has "(disambiguation)" in its title – in that case use {{R to disambiguation page}} instead.


To a project page: This is a redirect from any page inside or outside of project (Wikipedia: or WP:) space to any page in the project namespace. The above category link leads to a list of redirects from inside project space.  Redirects from outside project space are automatically sorted to Category:Redirects to project space.


From a shortcut: This is a redirect from a shortcut in any namespace to a page in any namespace except template namespace.
Shortcuts are wikilinked on community pages, talk pages, and edit summaries, but not in mainspace articles.

When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
