The Olympic House allows the IOC to bring together its staff – 500 employees currently spread across Lausanne in four locations - under one roof at a single site. 


The IOC will now benefit from two Olympic centres in Lausanne: the Olympic House in Vidy to cater for its administration and offer a welcoming meeting place for IOC Members, and the entire Olympic Movement; and The Olympic Museum and the Olympic Studies Centre dedicated to general public activities in Ouchy.


More than a just a construction project, the Olympic House has been designed with flexibility and people’s engagement in mind. This was achieved through a dynamic internal collaborative process involving the IOC staff. By addressing individual and collective needs, the Headquarters will offer the IOC workforce a qualitative and contemporary working environment. It has been built to adapt to strategic or organisational changes to come, with an agile working environment dedicated to a mobile workforce.

The Olympic House functional description

    Ground floor: Hosting all hospitality functions (restaurant, conference centre, Agora and gym) and covered by a green plinth to foster integration within the park.
    Office floors: Three identical office floors organised around a central staircase and favouring flexibility. These three office floors promote transparency through a double-skin glass façade.
    Roof: Outdoor terrace and solar power installations (producing the equivalent of the yearly electricity consumption of 60 households in Lausanne).
    Basement: Underground car park and support areas (logistics and technical areas).
