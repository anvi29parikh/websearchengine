Using HTML codes within wikitext

The markup language called wikitext, also known as wiki markup or wikicode, consists of the syntax and keywords used by the MediaWiki software to format a page. (Note the lowercase spelling of these terms.)[a] To learn how to see this hypertext markup, and to save an edit, see Help:Editing. Generally, coding can be copied and pasted, without writing new code. There is a short list of markup and tips at Help:Cheatsheet.


In addition to wikitext, some HTML elements are also allowed for presentation formatting. See Help:HTML in wikitext for information on this.

Layout
Sections


Article sections in a page will follow that page's lead or introduction and, if there are four or more, the table of contents.

Section headings
Further information: Help:Section and Wikipedia:Manual of Style §&nbsp;Section headings


The = through ====== markup are headings for the sections with which they are associated.

A single = is styled as the article title and should not be used within an article.
Headings are styled through CSS and add an [edit] link. See this section for the relevant CSS.
Four or more headings cause a table of contents to be generated automatically.
Do not use any markup after the final heading markup – this will either break the heading, or will cause the heading to not be included in an edit summary.








Markup
Renders as 


= Heading 1 =
== Heading 2 ==
=== Heading 3 ===
==== Heading 4 ====
===== Heading 5 =====
====== Heading 6 ======



Heading 1
Heading 2
Heading 3
Heading 4
Heading 5
Heading 6











Templates: {{fake heading}} for use in documentation.

Horizontal rule
Further information: WP:LINE


The horizontal rule represents a paragraph-level thematic break. Do not use in article content, as rules are used only after main sections, and this is automatic.




Markup
Renders as 


----

















HTML equivalent: &lt;hr /&gt; (which can be indented, whereas ---- always starts at the left margin.)

Table of contents
Further information: WP:TOC


When a page has at least four headings, a table of contents (TOC) will automatically appear after the lead and before the first heading. The TOC can be controlled by magic words or templates:

__FORCETOC__ forces the TOC to appear at the normal location regardless of the number of headings.
__TOC__ forces the TOC to appear at the point where the magic word is inserted instead of the normal location.
__NOTOC__ disables the TOC entirely.
{{TOC limit}} template can be used to control the depth of subsections included in the TOC. This is useful where the TOC is long and unwieldy.
Category:Wikipedia table of contents templates contains a number of specialized TOC templates.
Line breaks
Further information: Help:Line-break handling and Wikipedia:Line breaks usage


Line breaks or newlines are used to add whitespace between lines, such as separating paragraphs.

A line break that is visible in the content is inserted by pressing ↵ Enter twice.
Pressing ↵ Enter once will place a line break in the markup, but it will not show in the rendered content, except when using list markup.
Markup such as bold or italics will be terminated at a line break.



Markup
Renders as 


A single newline here
has no effect on the layout.

But an empty line starts a new paragraph, 
or ends a list or an indented part.







A single newline here

But an empty line starts a new paragraph, 
or ends a list or an indented part.










HTML equivalent: &lt;br&gt; or &lt;br /&gt; can be used to break line layout.


Templates for line breaks:

{{break}} adds multiple line breaks.
{{-}} and {{clear}} adds a break with styling, to clear floating elements. (often used to prevent text from flowing next to unrelated tables or images)


Unbulleted list:

{{plainlist}} and {{unbulleted list}} both create an unbulleted list.
Indent text
Further information: WP:INDENT


Indentation is most commonly used on talk pages.




Markup

When there is a need for separating a block of text. This is useful for (as the name says) inserting blocks of quoted (and cited) text.




Markup
Renders as 


&lt;blockquote&gt;
The '''blockquote''' tag will indent both margins when needed instead of the left margin only as the colon does.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This uses an HTML tag; template {{quote}} results in the same render.

Center text

Markup
Renders as 


&lt;div class="center" style="width: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;Centered text&lt;/div&gt;


Centered text









Template {{center}} uses the same markup. To center a table, see Help:Table#Centering tables.
Please do not use &lt;center&gt;...&lt;/center&gt; tags, as it is obsolete.

Align text to right


You can align content in a separate container:




Markup
Renders as 


&lt;div style="text-align: right; direction: ltr; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;Text on the right&lt;/div&gt;


Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Lists

Do not leave blank lines between items in a list unless there is a reason to do so, since this causes the MediaWiki software to interpret each item as beginning a new list.

Description lists




ShortcutH:DL


To list terms and definitions, start a new line with a semicolon (;) followed by the term. Then, type a colon (:) followed by a definition. The format can also be used for other purposes, such as make and models of vehicles, etc.


Description lists (formerly definition lists, and a.k.a. association lists) consist of group names corresponding to values. Group names (terms) are in bold. Values (definitions) are indented. Each group must include one or more definitions. For a single or first value, the : can be placed on the same line after ; – but subsequent values must be placed on separate lines.


Do not use a semicolon (;) simply to bold a line without defining a value using a colon (:). This usage renders invalid HTML5 and creates issues with screen readers. Also, use of a colon to indent (other than for talk page responses) may also render invalid HTML5 and cause accessibility issues per MOS:INDENTGAP.

Retaining newlines and spaces
ShortcutH:POEM


The MediaWiki software suppresses single newlines and converts lines starting with a space to preformatted text in a dashed box. HTML suppresses multiple spaces. It is often desirable to retain these elements for poems, lyrics, mottoes, oaths and the like. The Poem extension adds HTML-like &lt;poem&gt;...&lt;/poem&gt; tags to maintain newlines and spaces. These tags may be used inside other tags such as &lt;blockquote&gt;...&lt;/blockquote&gt;; the template {{poemquote}} provides a convenient shorthand. CSS styles may be applied to this tag, e.g.: &lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em;"&gt;.

&lt;poem&gt;
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
  A stately pleasure-dome decree:
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran
  Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea.

So twice five miles of fertile ground
  With walls and towers were girdled round:
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,
  Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
And here were forests ancient as the hills,
  Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Poems and their translation can be presented side by side, and the language can be indicated with lang="xx". Following the last side-by-side block, {{Clear|left}} must be used to cancel "float:left;" and to re-establish normal flow. Note that this method does not require a table and its columns to achieve the side-by-side presentation.

Format

Description

What you type

What it looks like





italics, bold, small capital letters



To ''italicize text'', put two consecutive apostrophes on each side of it.

Three apostrophes each side will '''bold the text'''.

Five consecutive apostrophes on each side (two for italics plus three for bold) produces '''''bold italics'''''.

'''''Italic and bold formatting''''' works correctly only within a single line.

For text as {{smallcaps|small caps}}, use the template {{tl|smallcaps}}.





To italicize text, put two consecutive apostrophes on each side of it.


Three apostrophes each side will bold the text.


Five consecutive apostrophes on each side (two for italics plus three for bold) produces bold italics.


Italic and bold formatting works correctly only within a single line.


To reverse this effect where it has been automatically applied, use {{nobold}} and {{noitalic}}.


For text as small caps, use the template {{smallcaps}}.






Small chunks of source code within a line of normal text.


Code is displayed in a monospace font.



function &lt;code&gt;int m2()&lt;/code&gt; is nice.




function int m2() is nice.






Syntax highlighting for source code.


Computer code has colored text and more stringent formatting. For example, to define a function: int m2(), with highlights.


See here for a full list of supported languages that can be put in lang="????"



&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="cpp"&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int m2 (int ax, char *p_ax) {
  std::cout &lt;&lt;"Hello World!";
  return 0;
}&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int m2 (int ax, char *p_ax) {
  std::cout &lt;&lt;"Hello World!";
  return 0;
}






Small text



Use &lt;small&gt;small text&lt;/small&gt; only 
when necessary.





Use small text only when necessary.






a &lt;small&gt; span



To match, for example, the font-size used in an [[Help:Visual file markup#Caption|image caption]], the "small" tag can also be used to 
&lt;small style="font-size:87%;"&gt;reduce a text's font-size to 87%&lt;/small&gt;.





To match, for example, the font-size used in an image caption, the "small" tag can also be used to reduce a text's font-size to 87%.






Big text



Better not use &lt;big&gt;big text&lt;/big&gt;, unless &lt;small&gt;it's &lt;big&gt;within&lt;/big&gt; small&lt;/small&gt; text.





Better not use big text, unless it's within small text.






To prevent two words from becoming separated by a linewrap (e.g. Mr.&nbsp;Smith or 400&nbsp;km/h) a non-breaking space, sometimes also called a "non-printing character", may be used between them. (For three or more words, the template {{nowrap}} is probably more suitable.)



Mr.&amp;nbsp;Smith or 400&amp;nbsp;km/h




Mr.&nbsp;Smith or 400&nbsp;km/h






Extra spacing within text is usually best achieved using the {{pad}} template.



Mary {{pad|4.0em}} had a little lamb.




Mary &nbsp; had a little lamb.


Special characters
See also: Help:Special characters and List of XML and HTML character entity references


Special characters can often be displayed using numeric character references or character entity references. See Character encodings in HTML for more information. For example, &amp;Agrave; and &amp;#xC0; both render À (A-grave). Percent-encoding can't be used, as it works only in URLs.

Subscripts and superscripts
The Manual of Style prefers the &lt;sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt; formats, for example x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. So this should be used under most circumstances.
The latter methods of sub/superscripting cannot be used in the most general context, as they rely on Unicode support that may not be present on all users' machines.

Characters in the Private Use Area, and invisible formatting characters
Main article: MOS:TEXT §&nbsp;PUA and RTL


Invisible and PUA (Private Use Areas) characters should be avoided where possible.  When needed, they should both be replaced with their (hexa)decimal code values (as "&amp;#(x)...;").  This renders invisible characters visible, for manual editing, and allows AWB to process pages with PUA characters.  The latter should also be tagged with the {{PUA}} template for tracking and future maintenance.

The &lt;math&gt; tag typesets using LaTeX markup,[b] which may render as an image or as HTML, depending on environmental settings. The &lt;math&gt; tag is best for the complex formula on its own line in an image format. If you use this tag to put a formula in the line with text, put it in the {{nowrap}} template.
The {{math}} template uses HTML, and will size-match a serif font, and will also prevent line-wrap. All templates are sensitive to the = sign, so remember to replace = with {{=}} in template input, or start the input with 1=. Use wiki markup '' and ''' inside the {{math}} template, as well as other HTML entities. The {{math}} template is best for typeset formulas in line with the text.

Links and URLs
Main page: Help:Link
Wikilinks


Wikilinks are used in wikitext markup to produce internal links between pages. You create wikilinks by putting double square brackets around text designating the title of the page you want to link to. Thus, [[Texas]] will be rendered as Texas. Optionally, you can use a vertical bar (|) to customize the link title. For example, typing [[Texas|Lone Star State]] will produce Lone Star State, a link that is displayed as "Lone Star State" but in fact links to Texas.

Link to another wiki article
Internally, the first letter of the target page is automatically capitalized and spaces are represented as underscores (typing an underscore in the link has the same effect as typing a space, but is not recommended).
Thus the link hereafter is to the Web address en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport, which is the Wikipedia article with the name "Public transport". See also Canonicalization.
A red link is a page that doesn't exist yet; it can be created by clicking on the link.
A link to its own page will appear only as bold text.



Markup

London has [[public transport]].

Link to this page: "[[Help:Wikitext]]" will appear only as bold text.

The target ("piped") text must be placed first, then the text to be displayed second.

Automatically rename links
Simply typing the pipe character | after a link will automatically rename the link in certain circumstances. The next time you open the edit box you will see the expanded piped link. When previewing your edits, you will not see the expanded form until you press Save and Edit again. The same applies to links to sections within the same page.
See Pipe trick for details.

Link to a section of a page
The part after the hash sign (#) must match a section heading on the page. Matches must be exact in terms of spelling, case, and punctuation. Links to non-existent sections are not broken; they are treated as links to the beginning of the page.
Include "| link title" to create a stylish (piped) link title.
If sections have the same title, add a number to link to any but the first. #Example section 3 goes to the third section named "Example section". You can use the pipe and retype the section title to display the text without the # symbol.

Main pages: Help:Interlanguage links and Wikipedia:Complete list of language wikis available
After the launch of Wikidata, interlanguage links are now added through it. Links in articles should exist only in special cases, for example when an article in one language has two articles in another language.
To link to a corresponding page in another language, use the form: [[language code:Foreign title]].
It is recommended interlanguage links be placed at the very end of the article.
Interlanguage links are not visible within the formatted article, but instead appear as language links on the sidebar (to the left) under the menu section "languages".
NOTE: To create an inline link (a clickable link within the text) to any foreign language article, see Help:Interlanguage links#Inline interlanguage links and consider the usage notes.

External links
Single square brackets indicate an external link. Note the use of a space (not a pipe |) to separate the URL from the link text in a named link. Square brackets may be used as normal punctuation when not linking to anything – [like this].
A URL must begin with a supported URI scheme: https:// (preferably) and http:// will be supported by all browsers; irc://, ircs://, ftp://, news://, mailto:, and gopher:// will require a plugin or an external application. IPv6 addresses in URLs are currently not supported.
A URL containing certain characters will display and link incorrectly unless those characters are percent encoded. For example, a space must be replaced by %20. Encoding can be achieved by:
Use the link button  on the enhanced editing toolbar to encode the link; this tool will add the bracket markup and the linked text, which may not always be desirable.
Or manually encode the URL by replacing these characters:


space
"
'
,
;
&lt;
&gt;
?
[
]


%20
%22
%27
%2c
%3b
%3c
%3e
%3f

Or use the {{urlencode:}} magic word. See Help:Magic words in the MediaWiki documentation for more details.

The image name, the word thumb then the caption&nbsp;:
  Wikipedia logo 


The thumb tag automatically allows the image to be enlarged and positions it (floats) automatically to the right of the page.
An enlarge icon is placed in the lower right corner.
See note below about adding an alt tag
This is the basic markup for most images







A picture: [[File:wiki.png]]

A picture: 


The picture name alone places the image in the text, or on the next line if there is insufficient space.
Embedding the image in the text is only possible for very small images.
Embedding the image will affect the vertical formatting of text.


With alternative text: 
[[File:wiki.png|alt=Puzzle globe logo]]

With alternative text:






Alternative text, used when the image is unavailable or when the image is loaded in a text-only browser, or when spoken aloud, is strongly encouraged. See Alternative text for images for help on choosing it.


With link: 
[[File:wiki.png|link=Wikipedia]]

With link:
 


The link directs to the Wikipedia page, Wikipedia, instead of the image file page.

Templates and transcluding pages
Main page: Wikipedia:Transclusion
See also: Help:Template §&nbsp;Noinclude, includeonly, and onlyinclude


Examples for templates: {{pad|...}}, {{math|...}}, {{as of|...}}, {{edit}}


Templates are segments of wiki markup that are meant to be copied automatically ("transcluded") into a page.
They are specified by putting the template's name in {{double braces}}. Most templates are pages in the Template namespace, but it is possible to transclude mainspace pages (articles) by using {{:colon and double braces}}.


There are three pairs of tags that can be used in wikitext to control how transclusion affects parts of a template or article.
They determine whether or not wikitext renders, either in its own article, which we will call "here", or in another article where it is transcluded, which we will call "there".

&lt;noinclude&gt;:  the content will not be rendered there. These tags have no effect here.
&lt;includeonly&gt;:  the content  will render only there, and  will not render here (like invisible ink made visible by means of transclusion).
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;:  the content will render here and will render there, but it will only render there what is between these tags.


There can be several such section "elements". Also, they can be nested. All possible renderings are achievable. For example, to render there one or more sections of the page here use &lt;onlyinclude&gt; tags. To append text there, wrap the addition in &lt;includeonly&gt; tags before, within, or after the section. To omit portions of the section, nest &lt;noinclude&gt; tags within it.


If a page is transcluded without transclusion markup, it may cause an unintentional categorization. Any page transcluding it will contain the same category as the original page. Wrap the category markup with &lt;noinclude&gt; tags to prevent incorrect categorization.

Some templates take parameters, as well, which you separate with the pipe character |.

Coloring and highlighting text
Using the {{Color}} and {{Font color}} templates:


What you type

What it looks like





I will change the color in {{color|blue|the middle part of}} this sentence.





I will change the color in the middle part of this sentence.






This is how to {{Font color||yellow|highlight part of a sentence}}.





This is how to highlight part of a sentence.


Example text


The {{xt}} family of templates can be used on help pages and user pages to highlight example text. 


These do not work in mainspace; that is, in articles.

What you get


This is an {{xt|A correct example}} for comparison {{tick}}

Show deleted or inserted text
Further information: Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines
When editing regular Wikipedia articles, just make your changes, and do not mark them up in any special way.
But, when the article itself discusses deleted or inserted content, such as an amendment to a statute:
it is best to indicate deleted content using the strike-through markup &lt;del&gt;...&lt;/del&gt;
it is best to indicate inserted content using the underline markup &lt;ins&gt;...&lt;/ins&gt;
However, when editing your own previous remarks in talk pages, it is often appropriate to mark up deleted or inserted content - especially if editing is necessary after the original text has already received a response:
deleted content may be indicated using the strike-through markup &lt;s&gt;...&lt;/s&gt;
new content inserted may be indicated using the underline markup &lt;u&gt;...&lt;/u&gt;


Note: &lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt; and &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt; (speced in HTML 3 &amp; 4) are considerably more popular than &lt;del&gt;&lt;/del&gt; and &lt;ins&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;  (speced in HTML 5) on Wikipedia.



What you type

What it looks like





You can &lt;del&gt;strike out deleted material&lt;/del&gt; and &lt;ins&gt;underline new material&lt;/ins&gt;.





You can strike out deleted material and underline new material.






Alternative markup:


You can &lt;s&gt;strike out deleted material&lt;/s&gt; and &lt;u&gt;underline new material&lt;/u&gt;.









You can strike out deleted material and underline new material.


Strike through



This is also possible with the {{strike}} template.

 Limiting formatting / escaping wiki markup


A few different kinds of formatting will tell the wiki to display things as you typed them – what you see is what you get!

&lt;nowiki&gt;
The &lt;nowiki&gt; tag ignores [[wiki]]
''markup''. It reformats text by
removing newlines and    multiple
spaces.       It still interprets
characters specified by

Nowiki




"WP:NOWIKI" redirects here. For the essay about the name "Wiki", see Wikipedia:Don't abbreviate "Wikipedia" as "Wiki"!
ShortcutsH:NOWIKIWP:NOWIKI
&lt;nowiki&gt;...&lt;/nowiki&gt; (wiki markup contained between these two tags is ignored)
&lt;nowiki /&gt; (Effects of wiki markup will not affect text that follows[clarification needed] this tag)


The two kinds of nowiki operate in different ways but both neutralize the rendering of wiki markup. As shown in the examples below, editors can normalize the font of characters trailing a wikilink, which would otherwise appear in the wikilink font. They can also add newlines to wikitext for readability.


Template editors: tag &lt;nowiki&gt; works only on its source page, not the target.


(Only at the beginning of a line do *, #, ; or : have special meaning.)

[[Example]]

 


&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!-- revealed --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;




   &lt;!-- revealed --&gt;    










The rest of the section consists of simple, live examples showing how a single nowiki tag escapes entire linkage structures, beyond [[&nbsp;wikilink&nbsp;]] and {{&nbsp;template&nbsp;}}:

[[ fullpagename | label ]]
{{ pagename | parameter }}
[[fullpagename | {{ pagename }} ]]
{{ pagename | [[ fullpagename ]] }}
{{ pagename | {{ pagename }} }}


Unless you use the two "balanced" nowiki tags, troubleshooting strip marker errors and template parameter-handling inconsistencies is a risk. Also, a rendering error may arise when two [[...]] square brackets are on the same line, or two {{...}} curly brackets are in the same section, but only when the two have the nowiki markup placed inconsistently.

Displaying wikilinks


(These are all live examples.)

[[ wp:pagename | page name ]]
[&lt;nowiki /&gt;[ wp:pagename | page name ]]
[[&lt;nowiki /&gt; wp:pagename | page name ]]
[[ wp:pagename &lt;nowiki /&gt;| page name ]]
[[ wp:pagename | page name ]&lt;nowiki /&gt;]



 page name 

[[ wp:pagename | page name ]]

[[ wp:pagename | page name ]]

[[ wp:pagename | page name ]]

[[wp:pagename | page name ]] 




For nested structures, escaping an inner structure escapes its outer structure too.

[[ wp: {{ 1x | pagename }} ]]
[[ wp: {&lt;nowiki /&gt;{ 1x | pagename }} ]]
[[ wp: {{&lt;nowiki /&gt; 1x | pagename }} ]]
[[ wp: {{ 1x &lt;nowiki /&gt;| pagename }} ]]



wp:  pagename  

[[ wp: {{ 1x | pagename }} ]]

[[ wp: {{ 1x | pagename }} ]]

[[ wp: {{ 1x | pagename }} ]]




For two, first pipes, two nowiki tags are required: 

[[ wp: pagename | {{ 1x | label }} ]]
[[ wp: pagename &lt;nowiki /&gt;| {{ 1x &lt;nowiki /&gt;| label }} ]]
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[ wp: pagename | {{ 1x | label }} ]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;



  label  

[[ wp: pagename | {{ 1x | label }} ]]

[[ wp: pagename | {{ 1x | label }} ]] 


Displaying template calls
See also: Template:tl


For templates, put nowiki before the first pipe.
If a parameter has a wikilink, put it in that, an inmost position.

{&lt;nowiki /&gt;{ val | u=&amp;gt; [[ms]] | 49082 }}
{{&lt;nowiki /&gt; val | u=&amp;gt; [[ms]] | 49082 }}
{{ val &lt;nowiki /&gt;| u=&amp;gt; [[ms]] | 49082 }}
{{ val | u= &gt; [[ms]] | 49082 }&lt;nowiki /&gt;}
{{ val | u= &gt; [[ ms ]&lt;nowiki /&gt;] | 49082 }} 



{{ val | u=&gt; ms | 49082 }}

{{ val | u= &gt; ms | 49082 }}

{{ val | u=&gt; ms | 49082 }}

{{ val | u=&gt; ms | 49082 }}

{{ val | u= &gt; [[ ms ]] | 49082 }} Y


Displaying magic words
Further information: Help:Magic words and Help:Parser function


For input parameters, {{{1}}}, {{{2}}}, just write them out, unless they have a default (which goes behind their pipe): 
{{&lt;nowiki /&gt;{1|default}}} → {{{1|default}}}


For a parser function nowiki goes between bracketing-pair characters, or anywhere before the&nbsp;: colon.

{{ #ifeq: inYes | inYes | outYes | outNo }}
{&lt;nowiki /&gt;{ #ifeq: inYes | inYes | outYes | outNo }}
{{&lt;nowiki /&gt; #ifeq: inYes | inYes | outYes | outNo }}
{{ #ifeq&lt;nowiki /&gt;: inYes | inYes | outYes | outNo }}
{{ #ifeq: inYes | inYes | outYes | outNo }&lt;nowiki /&gt;}



outYes

{{ #ifeq: inYes | inYes | outYes | outNo }}

{{ #ifeq: inYes | inYes | outYes | outNo }}

{{ #ifeq: inYes | inYes | outYes | outNo }} 

{{ #ifeq: inYes | inYes | outYes | outNo }}




Behavioral switches expect the tag anywhere:

 1. __HIDDENCAT__
 2. __HIDDENCAT&lt;nowiki /&gt;__
1. 

2. __HIDDENCAT__
Displaying tags


&lt;tags&gt; do not display; they are just markup. If you want them to, insert &lt;nowiki /&gt; after an &lt; opening angle bracket; it goes only in the very front. Opening tags and closing tags must be treated separately.

&lt;span style=color:blue&gt; Blue &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;&lt;nowiki /&gt;span style=color:blue&gt; Blue &lt;&lt;nowiki /&gt;/span&gt;
&lt;section end=la&lt;nowiki /&gt;bel /&gt; 



 Blue 

&lt;span style=color:blue&gt; Blue &lt;/span&gt;

bel /&gt; N




Use template {{tag}} instead of nowiki tags to display parser tags:


Character entities, nowiki cannot escape.  
To escape HTML or special character entities, replace &amp; with &amp;amp;.
For example, &amp;amp;lt; → &amp;lt;


To display a nowiki tag, you can (1) use {{tag}}, (2) replace the &lt; left angle bracket with its HTML character entity, or (3) nest nowiki tags in each other:

{{ tag | nowiki }}
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt; nowiki&gt;...&amp;lt;/ nowiki &gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;nowiki /&gt;nowiki&gt;...&lt;&lt;nowiki /&gt;/ nowiki &gt;&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;nowiki&gt;...&lt;/ nowiki &gt;

&lt; nowiki&gt;...&lt;/ nowiki &gt;

&lt; nowiki&gt;...&lt;/ nowiki &gt;


{{ tag | nowiki | s }}
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt; nowiki /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;nowiki /&gt; nowiki /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt; nowiki /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;



&lt;nowiki /&gt;

&lt; nowiki /&gt;

&lt; nowiki /&gt;

&lt; nowiki /&gt;




Nowiki tags do not otherwise nest, so it is the second and fourth that displays:

1&lt;nowiki&gt;2&lt;nowiki&gt;3&lt;/nowiki&gt;4&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{!}}&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{!}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;




12&lt;nowiki&gt;34&lt;/nowiki&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; second and fourth 

{{!}}&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;




These simply scan from left to right.
The paired tags cannot overlap, because the very first pair-match nullifies any intervening tags inside. Unbalanced tags always display.


Nowiki tags do not display table markup, use &lt;pre&gt;...&lt;/pre&gt;.

Pre
ShortcutWP:PRE


&lt;pre&gt; is a parser tag that emulates the HTML &lt;pre&gt; tag. It defines preformatted text that is displayed in a fixed-width font and is enclosed in a dashed box. HTML and wiki markups are escaped and spaces and line breaks are preserved, but HTML entities are parsed.


&lt;pre&gt; examples


Markup
Renders as 


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;!--Comment--&gt;

[[wiki]] markup &amp;amp;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;!--Comment--&gt;

[[wiki]] markup &amp;amp;










&lt;pre&gt; formatted text does not wrap, thus text may extend past the browser window:

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.


To resolve this, &lt;pre&gt; may use CSS styling to add wrapping or a horizontal scrollbar:

Wrapping: &lt;pre style="white-space:-moz-pre-wrap; white-space:-pre-wrap; white-space:-o-pre-wrap; white-space:pre-wrap; word-wrap:break-word;"&gt;
Scroll bar: &lt;pre style="overflow:auto; width:auto;"&gt;


As &lt;pre&gt; is a parser tag, it escapes wikitext and HTML tags. This can be prevented with the use of &lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt; within the &lt;pre&gt;, making it act more like its HTML equivalent:


&lt;pre&gt; with &lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt; example


Markup
Renders as 


&lt;pre&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&gt;&lt;!--Comment--&gt;

[[wiki]] markup &amp;amp;&lt;/pre&gt;



wiki markup &amp;









Invisible HTML &lt;pre&gt; tags can also be inserted by preceding text with a space character, like:

wiki markup &amp;



Alternatively, consider using {{pre}} template or &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;...&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;.

Invisible text (comments)
See also: Help:Hidden text


It's uncommon&nbsp;– but on occasion acceptable for notes to other editors&nbsp;– to add a hidden comment within the text of an article. These comments are visible only when editing or viewing the source of a page. Most comments should go on the appropriate Talk page.  The format is to surround the hidden text with "&lt;!--" and "--&gt;" and may cover several lines, e.g.:

&lt;!-- An example of hidden comments
 This won't be visible except in "edit" mode. --&gt;



Another way to include a comment in the wiki markup uses the {{Void}} template, which can be abbreviated as {{^}}. This template "expands" to the empty string, generating no HTML output; it is visible only to people editing the wiki source. Thus {{^|A lengthy comment here}} operates similarly to the comment &lt;!-- A lengthy comment here --&gt;. The main difference is that the template version can be nested, while attempting to nest HTML comments produces odd results.

{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}} is the number of pages in the main namespace that contain a link and are not a redirect. This includes full articles, stubs containing a link, and disambiguation pages.


{{CURRENTMONTHNAMEGEN}} is the genitive (possessive) grammatical form of the month name, as used in some languages but not in English; {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} is the nominative (subject) form, as usually seen in English.


In languages where it makes a difference, you can use constructs like {{grammar:case|word}} to convert a word from the nominative case to some other case. For example, {{grammar:genitive|{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}}}} means the same as {{CURRENTMONTHNAMEGEN}}.
