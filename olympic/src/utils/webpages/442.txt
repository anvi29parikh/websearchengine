The IOC's mission is to place athletes at the heart of the Olympic Movement and Olympic Agenda 2020 recommendations further support and protect clean and fair sport. The IOC Athletes' Commission serves as a link between the athletes and the IOC. In order to achieve this, the IOC Athletes' Commission has the leading role with athletes and with the Olympic Movement.


The Mission of the IOC Athletes' Commission is to ensure that the athletes' viewpoint remains at the heart of the Olympic Movement decisions. 


The responsibilities of the IOC Athletes' Commission are to:

• Empower Athlete Representation in Olympic Movement decision-making processes.

• Support Athlete Development in their sporting and non-sporting careers.

• Promote Athlete Involvement in decision-making across the Olympic Movement.

• Ensure Athlete Representation in Olympic Movement decision-making.

If you are an Olympic athlete, there are a few ways that you can get involved in the work of the Commission. You can stand as a candidate in the elections organised at each edition of the Olympic Games or you can vote to elect representatives of your choice.


You can liaise with the Athletes’ Commission of your NOC or IF or you can forward your comments to the IOC Athletes’ Commission

IOC Athlete Career Programme



In February 2005, the IOC launched the IOC Athlete Career Programme (IOC ACP), which now comprises three main axes:



Education: providing information, a list of criteria and a checklist enabling athletes to undertake a “dual career” (sport and studies) in the best conditions.



Life skills: making available practical files giving athletes information, advice or a checklist concerning subjects related to their daily lives (nutrition, the fight against doping, financial planning, etc).



Employment: services related to career preparation and management (drafting CVs preparing job interviews, etc.) offered to the athletes, during and after their high-level sports career.
