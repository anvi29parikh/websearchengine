The IOC is committed to strengthening the integrity of sports organisations and protecting clean athletes.


The fight against doping and any other forms of cheating in sport on the one hand, and the strengthening of ethics with improvements in transparency, good governance and accountability of sports organisations on the other, have been top priorities for the IOC. 


Integrity entails credibility, and the credibility of competitions and sports organisations is one of the three pillars of Olympic Agenda 2020. If the credibility of sports competitions suffers, then sooner or later the credibility of sports organisations will suffer. The same is true the other way around.


The IOC has continuously set up structures, policies, processes and programmes to improve integrity at competitions and within its own organisation, and any time it was needed, the IOC acted to tackle ethical misconduct. As leader of the Olympic Movement, it has also worked with the various stakeholders of the Olympic Movement to help enhance governance across all levels. To maximise the impact of these activities, the IOC has likewise coordinated with governments, international organisations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and many more stakeholders. These efforts are ongoing and keep evolving to anticipate new trends and adjust to new situations in the best possible way.
