The Playbooks are the basis of our game plan to ensure all Olympic and Paralympic Games participants and the people of Japan stay safe and healthy this summer. 

They have been developed jointly by Tokyo 2020, the IOC and the IPC in close collaboration with the Government of Japan and TMG. They are also based on the extensive work of the All Partners Task Force and collaborations with scientific experts and organisations from across the world.


Versions released in early February 2021 outlined the responsibilities of all Games participants and the rules that must be followed – starting 14 days before you travel as well as entering Japan, at the Games, and leaving Japan.


Versions released in April provided updated guidance and further detail on how the Games will be organised, so that the athletes and all Olympic Games stakeholders could finalise and implement their plans.


And this third version of the Playbook provides all the additional necessary information for all Games participants.


The success of these Games depends on every single one of us taking responsibility for following the Playbook at all times – starting now.
