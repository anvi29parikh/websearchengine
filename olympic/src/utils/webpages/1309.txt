Redirect to:Wikipedia:Protection policy#Full protection This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect:

To a project page: This is a redirect from any page inside or outside of project (Wikipedia: or WP:) space to any page in the project namespace. The above category link leads to a list of redirects from inside project space.  Redirects from outside project space are automatically sorted to Category:Redirects to project space.


To a section: This is a redirect from a topic that does not have its own page to a section of a page on the subject. For redirects to embedded anchors on a page, use {{R to anchor}} instead.


From a shortcut: This is a redirect from a shortcut in any namespace to a page in any namespace except template namespace.
Shortcuts are wikilinked on community pages, talk pages, and edit summaries, but not in mainspace articles.

When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
