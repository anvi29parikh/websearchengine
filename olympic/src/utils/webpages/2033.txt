Wilhelm Schmalz[edit]


My edit of the page of Wilhelm Schmalz was removed. I am doing research about the legacy of Wilhelm Schmalz and found one of his distant descendants. This edit was removed without any reason. TSchmlz (talk) 15:49, 30 October 2021 (UTC)

@TSchmlz I gave reasons each time I reverted you (Serols didn't).

Hello.  I see you've installed a modified version of DisamAssist.  Please beware that there are a few differences between "my" version and the "official" one, listed here, and they may diverge further in future.  Code diffs: DisamAssist and core.

Thank you for letting me know. Will be glad to adhere to your request. Red Director (talk) 12:30, 31 October 2021 (UTC)

Short descriptions[edit]


Hello again. I do not think it is a good idea to do those semi-automatically. In my experience working on those, various article subjects have some unique differences about them that require some notice to detail. Most are uniform for the most part, but I do run into some that require kind of a unique or close to unique short description. I welcome any advice on your side though. Red Director (talk) 13:37, 31 October 2021 (UTC)

RfA Reform 2021 Phase 2 has begun[edit]



Following a 2 week brainstorming period and a 1 week proposal period, the 30 day discussion of changes to our Request for Adminship process has begun. Following feedback on Phase 1, in order to ensure that the largest number of people possible can see all proposals, new proposals will only be accepted for the for the first 7 days of Phase 2. The 30 day discussion is scheduled to last until November 30. Please join the discussion or even submit your own proposal.


There is 1 future mailing planned with the results of Phase 2. To opt-out of future mailings, please remove yourself here.

I actually stole it from User:Chlod lol, you can even see the exact same disclaimer. I modified it for my talk page though, so it says "sportzpikachu: talk" instead of "User talk:Sportzpikachu".

Speedy deletion nomination of Category:Government ministers with physical disabilities[edit]



A tag has been placed on Category:Government ministers with physical disabilities indicating that it is currently empty, and is not a disambiguation category, a category redirect, a featured topics category, under discussion at Categories for discussion, or a project category that by its nature may become empty on occasion. If it remains empty for seven days or more, it may be deleted under section C1 of the criteria for speedy deletion. 


If you think this page should not be deleted for this reason you may contest the nomination by visiting the page and clicking the button labelled "Contest this speedy deletion". This will give you the opportunity to explain why you believe the page should not be deleted. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag from the page yourself.   Liz Read! Talk! 17:41, 3 November 2021 (UTC)

Hello, Qwerfjkl,
I realize that you create categories on request. The editor who requested this one has 7 days to assign a page to this category or it will be deleted so that's a sufficient amount of time. Categories deleted only for being empty can be recreated whenever there is a need for them later. Thanks. Liz Read! Talk! 17:43, 3 November 2021 (UTC)
It's fine, I can easily mass-categorise articles.&nbsp;―&nbsp;Qwerfjkltalk 17:45, 3 November 2021 (UTC)

Tech News: 2021-45[edit]



Latest tech news from the Wikimedia technical community. Please tell other users about these changes. Not all changes will affect you. Translations are available.


Recent changes

Mobile IP editors are now able to receive warning notices indicating they have a talk page message on the mobile website (similar to the orange banners available on desktop). These notices will be displayed on every page outside of the main namespace and every time the user attempts to edit. The notice on desktop now has a slightly different colour. [2][3]


Changes later this week

Wikidata will be read-only for a few minutes on 11 November. This will happen around 06:00 UTC. This is for database maintenance. [4]
There is no new MediaWiki version this week.


Future changes

In the future, unregistered editors will be given an identity that is not their IP address. This is for legal reasons. A new user right will let editors who need to know the IPs of unregistered accounts to fight vandalism, spam, and harassment, see the IP. You can read the suggestions for how that identity could work and discuss on the talk page.

bot problem?[edit]


Hello Qwerfjkl, please check your settings for your bot, User:Qwerfjkl (bot). In Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Qwerfjkl (bot) 2 it is listed as exclusion compliant, however in this edit it appears to have ignored that: Special:PermaLink/1054543578.  Notice that your bot was already in a deny list when it made that edit. — xaosflux Talk 18:09, 11 November 2021 (UTC)

@John Maynard Friedman: - this is the follow up from VP. — xaosflux Talk 18:10, 11 November 2021 (UTC)


Hello Qwerfjkl, is the correct syntax {{bots|deny=Qwerfjkl (bot)}}, because it doesn't fend off the bot. {{bots|deny=Qwerfjkl}} hasn't been over-ridden yet but is that just good luck? --John Maynard Friedman (talk) 20:02, 11 November 2021 (UTC)

That's something you would need to discuss with the developers of your framework.  If it isn't working right you will need to stop using it until you can resolve it.  Did you reivew the specific edit I linked to and agree that you should not have made that edit based on the bots directive? — xaosflux Talk 15:11, 12 November 2021 (UTC)
Yes, I agree the bot should not have made this edit.&nbsp;―&nbsp;Qwerfjkltalk 15:33, 12 November 2021 (UTC)
@Xaosflux Adding the skip condition "contains \{\{(no)?bots" seems to have worked.&nbsp;―&nbsp;Qwerfjkltalk 15:41, 12 November 2021 (UTC)
Thanks, that is probably overkill, but certainly will fix this problem.  Overkill in that it will make you skip pages like {{bots|deny=Someotherbot}}. — xaosflux Talk 15:42, 12 November 2021 (UTC)
Better than editing pages that explicitly deny the bot. Thank you for your time, Xaoslfux, and thank you @John Maynard Friedman for alerting me to this issue (indirectly).&nbsp;―&nbsp;Qwerfjkltalk 15:44, 12 November 2021 (UTC)
Bot blocked[edit]
User:Qwerfjkl (bot) has been blocked for not respecting exclusion compliance indicated in Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Qwerfjkl (bot) 2.  Pleae review your bot code.  Once you have resolve your programming issue, please let me know for an unblock.  Any admin is welcome to unblock this account once Qwerfjkl validates that the error has been resolved. — xaosflux Talk 19:53, 17 November 2021 (UTC)
Example of the offending edit: here. — xaosflux Talk 19:54, 17 November 2021 (UTC)
Thanks. I'll check this more carefully this time and ensure it is exclusion compliant.&nbsp;―&nbsp;Qwerfjkltalk 20:01, 17 November 2021 (UTC)
Have you been able to validate that the problem is actually resolved - you should be able to test that without editing. (Please @ping me here when done for an unblock). — xaosflux Talk 16:17, 18 November 2021 (UTC)
@Xaosflux: The skipping now works (according to the skip log) on Ordinal indicator (after I re-added the template). Can you unblock the bot so I can make sure it works properly?&nbsp;―&nbsp;Qwerfjkltalk 17:51, 18 November 2021 (UTC)

 This user's unblock request has been reviewed by an administrator, who accepted the request. 


Qwerfjkl (block log • active blocks • global blocks • contribs • deleted contribs • filter log • creation log • change block settings • unblock • checkuser (log))





Request reason:

See above.


Accept reason:

Unblocked per above. — xaosflux Talk 18:16, 18 November 2021 (UTC)



If you want to make any further unblock requests, please read the guide to appealing blocks first, then use the {{unblock}} template again. If you make too many unconvincing or disruptive unblock requests, you may be prevented from editing this page until your block has expired.


@Xaosflux: The most recent run seems to have worked, so it should be fine now.&nbsp;―&nbsp;Qwerfjkltalk 10:45, 19 November 2021 (UTC)

Rupert Bruce-Mitford[edit]


Many of these edits were helpful. An SBN, however, is not the same thing as an ISBN (history discussed here), leading to the errors seen here. Also, although the bot's edit description noted that "Ordinal numbers should be in regular text, not inside &lt;sup&gt; tags", the &lt;sup&gt; tags that were used were to maintain the formatting of the source. --Usernameunique (talk) 23:28, 13 November 2021 (UTC)

@Usernameunique Hi, thanks for reporting this! You can stop this bot (and any other AWB bot) from re-editing the page by adding {{Bots|deny=AWB}} anywhere in the page (an invisible comment will help). You can see the related discussions above this section. Regarding the ISBN → SBN change, you might want to follow this up at WT:AWB, as it is part of AWB's Genfixes.&nbsp;―&nbsp;Qwerfjkltalk 23:37, 13 November 2021 (UTC)
Question from SimDefinitions (20:19, 14 November 2021)[edit]


Hi! It's not letting me write anything when editing texts. The keyboard's not popping up and I don't know what's wrong. --SimDefinitions (talk) 20:19, 14 November 2021 (UTC)

@SimDefinitions Hi, can you describe the exact steps to reproduce this, including the browser and device? I presume from The keyboard's not popping up you're on mobile.&nbsp;―&nbsp;Qwerfjkltalk 20:55, 14 November 2021 (UTC)
New page reviewer granted[edit]



Hi Qwerfjkl. Your account has been added to the "New page reviewers" user group. Please check back at WP:PERM in case your user right is time limited or probationary. This user group allows you to review new pages through the Curation  system and mark them as patrolled, tag them for maintenance issues, or nominate them for deletion. The list of articles awaiting review is located at the New Pages Feed. New page reviewing is vital to maintaining the integrity of the encyclopedia. If you have not already done so, you must read the  tutorial at New Pages Review, the linked guides and essays, and fully understand the deletion policy. If you need any help or want to discuss the process, you are welcome to use the new page reviewer talk page. In addition, please remember:

Be nice to new editors. They are usually not aware that they are doing anything wrong. Do  make use of the message feature when tagging  pages for  maintenance so  that  they are aware.
You will frequently be asked by users to explain why their page is being deleted. Please be formal and polite in your approach to them – even if they are not.
If you are not sure what to do with a page, don't review it – just leave it for another reviewer.
Accuracy is more important than speed. Take your time to patrol each page. Use the message feature to communicate with article creators and offer advice as much as possible.


The reviewer right does not change your status or how you can edit articles. If you no longer want this user right, you also may ask any administrator to remove it for you at any time. In cases of abuse or persistent inaccuracy of reviewing, or long-term inactivity, the right may be withdrawn at administrator discretion.  Seddon talk 23:16, 14 November 2021 (UTC)

I have listed a page you reviewed for deletion at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brian Femminella.  A second page you reviewed, Three Thousand Stitches, appears to be using Goodreads as a source, which is discouraged.  And a third, Laurie Franks, has some obviously malformed references.  Please be more diligent when doing NPP reviews. User:力 (powera, π, ν) 01:22, 21 November 2021 (UTC)
Tech News: 2021-46[edit]



Latest tech news from the Wikimedia technical community. Please tell other users about these changes. Not all changes will affect you. Translations are available.


Recent changes

Most large file uploads errors that had messages like "stashfailed" or "DBQueryError" have now been fixed. An incident report is available.


Problems

Sometimes, edits made on iOS using the visual editor save groups of numbers as telephone number links, because of a feature in the operating system. This problem is under investigation. [5]
There was a problem with search last week. Many search requests did not work for 2 hours because of a configuration error. [6]


Changes later this week

 The new version of MediaWiki will be on test wikis and MediaWiki.org from 16 November. It will be on non-Wikipedia wikis and some Wikipedias from 17 November. It will be on all wikis from 18 November (calendar).

Help. --HELLO IM NAZEEF (talk) 08:07, 16 November 2021 (UTC)

@HELLO IM NAZEEF: Do you still need help with the problem you described here, or do you have another problem?&nbsp;―&nbsp;Qwerfjkltalk 16:28, 16 November 2021 (UTC)
Question from HELLO IM NAZEEF (16:40, 16 November 2021)[edit]


Hello.
Can you please help me with:
1. How to upload an image while editing an article on mobile?


2. How to make a template while editing an article on mobile? --HELLO IM NAZEEF (talk) 16:40, 16 November 2021 (UTC)

@HELLO IM NAZEEF:
You can try the mobile app, which I believe is the easiest way to upload images.
Add a link to the template (you can do this in your sandbox)  e.g. [[Template:Red-linked template]] → Template:Red-linked template. Then, click on the link, and add the wikitext. You may find Help:Templates of use.

Question from Cavygoagoses on Activated charcoal (medication) (05:18, 20 November 2021)[edit]


Hallo.... why can we not give activated charcoal when poisoned with acid methanol etc --Cavygoagoses (talk) 05:18, 20 November 2021 (UTC)

(Talk page enjoyer) @Cavygoagoses: Per the source cited in the article [7]: May be used for treatment (GI decontamination) in most oral poisonings except those [...] for which its absorptive capacity is too low to be clinically useful (e.g., iron salts, lithium, boric acid, arsenic, malathion, or organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, or ethylene glycol). Basically, it can't absorb a sufficient amount of the chemical to prevent significant harm. Elli (talk | contribs) 05:50, 20 November 2021 (UTC)
Question from Chabot4me (14:07, 21 November 2021)[edit]


Hello, 
I tried changing the address location on the page gor Leo Louis Chabot I created so it could have better attention. But I got a message it is not allowed because apparently I changed the User. So my question is… Is there a way to change the address so he can be found easier? --Chabot4me (talk) 14:07, 21 November 2021 (UTC)

@Chabot4me: Hi, are you talk about the draft located at User:Chabot4me/Sandbox? Are you trying to get the draft moved to mainspace?&nbsp;―&nbsp;Qwerfjkltalk 17:02, 21 November 2021 (UTC)


Yes that is correct, I was trying to move the draft. Or is that done by the robot.  —&nbsp;Preceding unsigned comment added by Chabot4me (talk • contribs) 20:48, 21 November 2021 (UTC) 

@Chabot4me: You can submit the draft for review by adding {{subst:submit}} to the top of the page. Please read WP:YFA.&nbsp;―&nbsp;Qwerfjkltalk 20:57, 21 November 2021 (UTC)
Can you give me some details in how to make a proper list?[edit]


All of my drafts are being deleted or rejectd for the same reason. My lists are incorrect and i dont know why. Scottlinehan1999 (talk) 12:52, 22 November 2021 (UTC)

Dang, you did a number on my redirect "awesome brah island"[edit]


That being said, I made that link years ago and it was certainly an inside joke that did not stand up to any scrutiny and was likely correctly admonished as a "blatant hoax", or at least "implausible"&nbsp;;)....I suppose I am just as sad to see it go as I am glad that the powers at be do not allow such jiggery pokery to go on indefinitely.

Relisting discussions at RfD[edit]


Please refrain from relisting discussions for a third time (especially if no discussion has occurred after the second relist). These type of discussions should be left for the next patrolling admin to handle them. And in some cases, a "no consensus" close is better than a relist. I recommend reading WP:RELIST and WP:SILENCE which will guide you on how to relist discussions properly. Thanks. CycloneYoris talk! 22:43, 26 November 2021 (UTC)

Special:Nuke[edit]
This request for help from administrators has been answered. If you need more help or have additional questions, please reapply the {{admin help}} template, or contact the responding user(s) directly on their own user talk page.
