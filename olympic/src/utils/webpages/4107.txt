Administrator intervention against vandalism



ShortcutWP:AIV


This page is intended only for reports about active, obvious, and persistent vandals and spammers. Before posting here, please read the spam and vandalism pages, as well as the AIV guide. To submit a report, edit this page and follow the instructions at the top of the "User-reported" section. For other issues that require administrator intervention, file a request for administrator attention elsewhere.


Important! Please remember the following:
The edits of the reported user must be obvious vandalism or obvious spam.
Except for egregious cases, the user must have been given enough warning(s) to stop their disruptive behavior.
The warning(s) must have been given recently and there must be reasonable grounds to believe the user(s) will further disrupt the site in the immediate future.
The appropriate vandal template below should be used if you decide that a report should be filed:
To report a logged-in user or user account, use the following template: * {{vandal|Example user}} Your concise reason (e.g. vandalised past 4th warning). ~~~~
To report an anonymous user or IP address, use the following template: * {{IPvandal|192.0.2.16}} Your concise reason (e.g. vandalised past 4th warning). ~~~~
Requests for further sanctions against a blocked user (e.g., talk page, e-mail blocks) should be made at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents, as a bot automatically removes reports made here about accounts that are blocked.
Reports of sockpuppetry should be made at Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations unless the connection between the accounts is obvious and disruption is recent and ongoing.
This noticeboard can quickly grow and become backlogged. The guidelines above are in place to help administrators focus on the most urgent issues. Administrators typically act quickly when apprised of clear vandalism and disruption. Before notifying administrators at another forum about a backlog on this page, consider whether the remaining reports are actionable. Stale reports are automatically cleared by MDanielsBot after 4–8 hours with no action.
