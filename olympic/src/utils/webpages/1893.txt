When used with the "Redirect category shell" (Rcat shell) template:

 This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect:

To a disambiguation page: This is a redirect to a disambiguation page. This redirect is intended for use in links from other articles that need to refer to the disambiguation page, rather than be disambiguated.  Therefore, this template should only appear on a redirect page that has "(disambiguation)" at the end of its title.  Ambiguous titles that do not have  page names ending with "(disambiguation)" may use {{R from ambiguous term}} instead. For disambiguations that later prove to still be ambiguous (e.g. "(painter)" when there are multiple notable painters by the same name) and which redirect to disambiguation pages, then {{R from incomplete disambiguation}} is the appropriate template.
Any talk page redirect that has "(disambiguation)" in its title targets another talk page, not a disambiguation page, and should be tagged with {{R from unnecessary disambiguation}} instead of this template.

When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
Template {{Redirect category shell}} may be used to add one or more rcat templates, along with their parameters and categories, to a redirect.  For more information see the documentation page below.



When used by itself:


To a disambiguation page: This is a redirect to a disambiguation page. This redirect is intended for use in links from other articles that need to refer to the disambiguation page, rather than be disambiguated.  Therefore, this template should only appear on a redirect page that has "(disambiguation)" at the end of its title.

Any talk page redirect that has "(disambiguation)" in its title targets another talk page, not a disambiguation page, and should be tagged with {{R from unnecessary disambiguation}} instead of this template.




 Template documentation[view] [edit] [history] [purge]
This template is used on approximately 238,000 pages.
 To avoid major disruption and server load, any changes should be tested in the template's /sandbox or /testcases subpages, or in your own user subpage. The tested changes can be added to this page in a single edit. Consider discussing changes on the talk page before implementing them.
If you plan to make breaking changes to this template, move it, or nominate it for deletion, please notify Twinkle's users and maintainers at Wikipedia talk:Twinkle as a courtesy, as this template is used in the standard installation of Twinkle. Thank you!
This template should not be substituted nor used to tag soft redirects.
Usage
Use this rcat template in any namespace.
This redirect category (rcat) template automatically populates Category:Redirects to disambiguation pages and, when the redirect is in main-article namespace (mainspace), this rcat also populates Category:Unprintworthy redirects by default.  In 2003, efforts were begun to support the Wikimedia Foundation's goal of increasing access and availability of  Wikipedia articles in printed versions.  Mainspace redirects to disambiguation pages are not suitable for a printed version.  In other words they are unprintworthy.
Please do not alter the printworthy settings of this rcat without first notifying the Version 1.0 Editorial Team, who are responsible for any and all materials, including redirects, that go into a printed version of Wikipedia.
A talk page redirect in any talk namespace that has "(disambiguation)" in its title targets another talk page, not a disambiguation page, so it should be tagged with {{R from unnecessary disambiguation}} instead of this template.
Place this rcat on a redirect page (never on a talk page redirect) in the following manner:
#REDIRECT [[(target page name)]]

{{Redirect category shell|
{{R to disambiguation page}}
}}

and when the redirect is in article mainspace, printworthiness should also be tagged:
#REDIRECT [[(target page name)]]

{{Redirect category shell|
{{R to disambiguation page}}
{{R unprintworthy}}
}}

Template {{Rcat shell}} is an alias for the Redirect category shell template, which may be used to add as many appropriate rcats as needed, usually from one to seven, along with their parameters, to a redirect.  For more information see the documentation on its template page.  This rcat may also tag a redirect individually:
#REDIRECT [[(target page name)]]

{{R to disambiguation page}}

This is in accord with instructions found at Wikipedia:REDCAT.
Use this rcat on all redirects to disambiguation (dab) pages if and only if the redirect on which this rcat is placed has the word "(disambiguation)" after its title.  If an ambiguous subject does not have a primary topic, then the name of the subject will be the title of a dab page and will not have the word "(disambiguation)" following their page name.  For these, there should always be a redirect titled with exactly the same title plus the word "(disambiguation)".  An example is the dab page Antenna, which does not have the word "(disambiguation)" after its title.  The associated redirect that does is Antenna (disambiguation), and that redirects to the "Antenna" page.  If one clicks that "Antenna (disambiguation)" link, then just below the page title, "Antenna", appear the phrases:
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Redirected from Antenna (disambiguation))
Click on that link either here or on the "Antenna" page to see the redirect.  That redirect, the one with the word "(disambiguation)" in its title, is the only kind of redirect that should be categorized by this rcat.
If this rcat tags a redirect that does not have "(disambiguation)" in its title, the redirect will populate Category:Pages with incorrectly transcluded disambiguation templates and will need to be repaired.
