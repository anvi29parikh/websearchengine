The International Sports Federations (IFs) are responsible for the integrity of their sport on the international level. 


The International Sports Federations are international non-governmental organisations recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as administering one or more sports at world level. The national federations administering those sports are affiliated to them. While conserving their independence and autonomy in the administration of their sports, International Sports Federations seeking IOC recognition must ensure that their statutes, practice and activities conform with the Olympic Charter.


The IFs have the responsibility and duty to manage and to monitor the everyday running of the world's various sports disciplines, including for those on the programme, the practical organisation of events during the Games. The IFs must also supervise the development of athletes practising these sports at every level. Each IF governs its sport at world level and ensures its promotion and development. They monitor the everyday administration of their sports and guarantee the regular organisation of competitions as well as respect for the rules of fair play.


The IFs may formulate proposals addressed to the IOC concerning the Olympic Charter and the Olympic Movement in general, including the organising and holding of the Olympic Games; give their opinions concerning the candidatures for organising the Olympic Games, particularly concerning the technical capabilities of the candidate cities; collaborate in the preparation of the Olympic Congresses; and participate in the activities of the IOC commissions.
Association of Federations


In order to discuss common problems and decide on their events calendars, the summer federations, the winter federations and the recognised federations have formed associations: the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF), the Association of International Olympic Winter Sports Federations (AIOWF), and the Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations (ARISF).
