Broadcast coverage is the principal means for people around the world to experience the magic of the Olympic Games.


The IOC is the owner of the global broadcast rights for the Olympic Games – including broadcasts on television, radio, mobile and internet platforms – and is responsible for allocating Olympic broadcast rights to media companies throughout the world through the negotiation of rights agreements.


Broadcast of the Olympic Games has been the principal driver of the:

    funding of the Olympic Movement and the Olympic Games
    growth of the global popularity of the Olympic Games
    global representation and promotion of the Olympic Games and the Olympic values

IOC
The IOC’s broadcast policy


The IOC’s broadcast policy is fundamentally based on the Olympic Charter, which is the codification of the Fundamental Principles, Rules and Bye-laws adopted by the IOC.


The Charter states:

"The IOC takes all necessary steps in order to ensure the fullest coverage by the different media and the widest possible audience in the world for the Olympic Games."
Olympic Broadcasting Services


OBS is responsible for providing the international television and radio signals from the Games to all rights-holding broadcasters around the world.


The IOC established Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) in 2001 to serve as the permanent host broadcaster for the Olympic Games, eliminating the need to continually rebuild the broadcast operation for each edition of the Games.


OBS ensures that the high standards of Olympic broadcasting are consistently maintained from one edition fo the Games to the next.
