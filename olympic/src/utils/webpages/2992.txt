From today's featured article






The jaguar (Panthera onca) is a large cat and the only Panthera species native to the Americas. With a body length of 1.12 to 1.85&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft 8&nbsp;in to 6&nbsp;ft 1&nbsp;in) and a weight of 56 to 96&nbsp;kg (123 to 212&nbsp;lb), it is the third-largest cat species in the world. Its coat is covered by spots that transition to rosettes on the sides. The jaguar's range extends from the southern U.S. through Mexico and across much of Central America to Paraguay and northern Argentina. It inhabits forested and open terrain, but prefers dense jungle. It is adept at swimming and is largely a solitary, opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush apex predator. The wild jaguar population is thought to have declined since the late 1990s, and is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching and human–wildlife conflict. Since 2002, it has been listed as a near-threatened species on the IUCN Red List. The jaguar has featured prominently in indigenous cultures of the Americas, including the Maya and Aztec civilizations. (Full&nbsp;article...)

Sigur Rós



The Shortlist Music Prize was an annual music award for the best album released in the United States that had sold fewer than 500,000 copies at the time of nomination. First given as a cash prize in 2001 under the name Shortlist Prize for Artistic Achievement in Music, the award was created by two music-industry directors, Greg Spotts and Tom Serig, as an alternative to the commercial Grammy Awards. The recipient was chosen by a panel of members of the entertainment industry and journalists known as "Listmakers". More than 50 of the best albums of the previous twelve months were picked before being narrowed down to the eponymous shortlist, from which a winner was chosen. At the end of 2001, the Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós (pictured) became the first recipients following a ceremony at the Hollywood Knitting Factory. The majority of the seven winners were singer-songwriters: Irishman Damien Rice won in 2003, Americans Sufjan Stevens and Cat Power won in 2005 and 2006, respectively, and Canadian Feist won in 2007.

Today's featured picture








The Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station is a storage power station in Bavaria, Germany. The turbines, seen here, are fed by water from the Walchensee which is then released into the Kochelsee. The power station uses the hydraulic head of about 200 metres (660&nbsp;ft) between the two natural lakes, and water from the Rißbach river is also used to augment the supply. The installed capacity is 124 MW with an annual production of 300 GWh; this is one of the largest of such power plants in Germany.
