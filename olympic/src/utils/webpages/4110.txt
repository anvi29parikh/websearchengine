Administrator instructions for Administrator intervention against vandalism:

If users make an invalid report, consider letting them know using template {{subst:uw-aiv}}, or better yet, similar wording in plain English, if you have time.
Be aware of any implications your block has for other people using a shared IP address and use "{{anonblock}}" or "{{schoolblock}}" as your reason for blocking when appropriate. WHOIS, Reverse DNS and the DNS Real-time Blacklist can be used to determine if an IP address is shared, dynamically allocated or has been compromised.
IP addresses should not usually be blocked indefinitely.
Check the user's contributions, deleted contributions, block log and warnings on the user's talk page carefully before taking any administrative action. All blocks should be made to prevent further damage to the project.
