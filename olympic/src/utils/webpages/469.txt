                            The Organising Committee for the Winter Youth Olympic Games (YOG) Gangwon 2024 has ensured that young people will play a key role in planning and promoting the Games by launching a new youth engagement programme.&nbsp;
                        
                    
            
        

            
                
            
    


    
        
        
            
                
            
            
    
        

            

Thirty young people have been selected to participate in the Youth Supporters initiative, which will see them work closely with the Organising Committee (GYOGOC) over the next year on the development of digital content, communications and other YOG-related activities to help engage youth throughout the host nation and beyond.


Among the Youth Supporters, who are all aged under 24, are eight young Korean athletes, including four from the Seoul Physical Education High School curling team and four from Sangji Daegwallyeong High School’s bobsleigh and skeleton teams.


“It is an honour to be part of the Youth Supporters programme of Gangwon 2024,” said Oh Kyu-nam, a 19-year-old curler from Seoul Physical Education High School, who is originally from Gangwon Province.


Kim Ji-yun is among five mentors who have also been selected to participate in the initiative.


“I volunteered as an interpreter at PyeongChang 2018 and now, for Gangwon 2024, I am a mentor,” said the 21-year-old. “I feel proud and responsible at the same time. I will make every effort to be a helpful youth mentor, showing great passion and using my experiences from PyeongChang 2018.”


In line with its vision – “Gangwon 2024 – youth celebrating peaceful coexistence and unity through sport to create a better future together” – GYOGOC aims to actively engage young people throughout the entire YOG project, empowering them to voice their opinions and enabling them to play a leading role in the delivery of the Games.


According to GYOGOC Secretary General Kim Chul-min, the Youth Supporters programme is the “first step” in ensuring the YOG are an event for young people, with young people and by young people.


“I am most delighted to see the very first step we have taken on this journey by initiating the Youth Supporters programme,” said Kim. “I look forward to your active participation to further promote Gangwon 2024, and the Organising Committee will spare no efforts to support and assist you in your journey with us.”
