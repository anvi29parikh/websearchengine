The Olympic Movement is the concerted, organised, universal and permanent action, carried out under the supreme authority of the IOC, of all individuals and entities who are inspired by the values of Olympism.


It covers the five continents. It reaches its peak with the bringing together of the world’s athletes at the great sports festival, the Olympic Games. Its symbol is five interlaced rings. 


The goal of the Olympic Movement is to contribute to building a peaceful and better world by educating youth through sport practised in accordance with Olympism and its values.


Belonging to the Olympic Movement requires compliance with the Olympic Charter and recognition by the IOC. 


The three main constituents of the Olympic Movement are the International Olympic Committee (“IOC”), the International Sports Federations (“IFs”) and the National Olympic Committees (“NOCs”).


In addition to its three main constituents, the Olympic Movement also encompasses the Organising Committees of the Olympic Games (“OCOGs”), the national associations, clubs and persons belonging to the IFs and NOCs, particularly the athletes, whose interests constitute a fundamental element of the Olympic Movement’s action, as well as the judges, referees, coaches and the other sports officials and technicians. It also includes other organisations and institutions as recognised by the IOC.

        
    

        National Olympic Committees
        
            

The mission of the NOCs is to develop, promote and protect the Olympic Movement in their respective countries, in accordance with the Olympic Charter. NOCs encourage the development of high performance sport as well as sport for all, while also providing training of sports administrators based on the Fundament Principles of Olympism.

        Organising Committees for the Olympic Games
        
            

The organisation of the Olympic Games is entrusted by the International Olympic Committee to the National Olympic Committee of the country of the host city as well as to the host city itself. The NOC forms, for that purpose, an Organising Committee that, from the time it is constituted, communicates directly with the IOC, from which it receives instructions.
