When used with the "Redirect category shell" (Rcat shell) template:

 This page is a redirect. The following categories are used to track and monitor this redirect:

From an ambiguous term: This is a redirect from an ambiguous page name to a page or list that disambiguates it. These redirects are pointed to by links that should always be disambiguated.  Therefore, this template should never appear on a page that has "(disambiguation)" in its title – in that case use {{R to disambiguation page}} instead.

When appropriate, protection levels are automatically sensed, described and categorized.
Template {{Redirect category shell}} may be used to add one or more rcat templates, along with their parameters and categories, to a redirect.  For more information see the documentation page below.



When used by itself:


From an ambiguous term: This is a redirect from an ambiguous page name to a page or list that disambiguates it. These redirects are pointed to by links that should always be disambiguated.  Therefore, this template should never appear on a page that has "(disambiguation)" in its title – in that case use {{R to disambiguation page}} instead.




 Template documentation[view] [edit] [history] [purge]
This template is used on approximately 30,000 pages and changes may be widely noticed. Test changes in the template's /sandbox or /testcases subpages, or in your own user subpage. Consider discussing changes on the talk page before implementing them.
This template should not be substituted or used to tag soft redirects.
Usage
Use this rcat template in any namespace.
This redirect category (rcat) template populates Category:Redirects from ambiguous terms and, when the redirect is in main-article namespace (mainspace), then Category:Unprintworthy redirects is also populated by default.  In 2003, efforts were begun to support the Wikimedia Foundation's goal of increasing access and availability of  Wikipedia articles in printed versions.  Mainspace redirects that are ambiguous titles are not suitable for a printed version.  In other words they are unprintworthy.  See below for what to do for the few redirects from ambiguous terms that are printworthy.
Please do not alter the printworthy settings of this rcat without first notifying the Version 1.0 Editorial Team, who are responsible for any and all materials, including redirects, that go into a printed version of Wikipedia.
Add this rcat to a redirect in the following manner:
#REDIRECT [[(target page name)]]

{{Rcat shell|
{{R from ambiguous term}}
}}

and when the redirect is in article mainspace, printworthiness should also be tagged:
#REDIRECT [[(target page name)]]

{{Rcat shell|
{{R from ambiguous term}}
{{R unprintworthy}}
}}

Template {{Rcat shell}} is an alias for the Redirect category shell template, which may be used to add as many appropriate rcats as needed, usually from one to seven, along with their parameters, to a redirect.  For more information see the documentation on its template page.  This rcat may also tag a redirect individually:
#REDIRECT [[(target page name)]]

{{R from ambiguous term}}

This is in accord with instructions found at Wikipedia:REDCAT.
Use this rcat on any redirect from an ambiguous term to a disambiguation page. These redirects are pointed to by links that should always be disambiguated. Therefore, this template should never appear on any page that has "(disambiguation)" in its title.  For those redirects use {{R to disambiguation page}} instead.
By default, this template tags redirects as unprintworthy.  To tag and categorize a redirect as printworthy, use the bar key ( ¦ ) on your keyboard to type the addition ¦printworthy in the following manner:
{{Rcat shell|
{{R from ambiguous term|printworthy}}
{{R printworthy}}
}}

Note:  The bar key ( ¦ ) on the keyboard renders as a pipe ( | ) on the screen.
That will subdue the default unprintworthy category and populate Category:Printworthy redirects instead.
