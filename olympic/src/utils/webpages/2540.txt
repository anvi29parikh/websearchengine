Inform&nbsp;?[edit]


What if you misinform? How to disacuss/correct a text published in 2019 and readalready by many people? How to collect the feathers [1]&nbsp;?Xx236 (talk) 07:35, 19 July 2021 (UTC)

Hallo!!! Xx236 (talk) 06:06, 21 July 2021 (UTC)
Responsible editors all want to avoid lashon hara, even if they don’t know the term. But first we need to know what the problem is. If it is an error in The Signpost, the editor in chief can issue retractions or corrections. If the error is elsewhere in English Wikipedia, we may be able to raise it to the attention of the community. ☆ Bri (talk) 12:56, 21 July 2021 (UTC)
Feel free to email me. I won't be able to get to it until Monday. In the interests of Truth and reconciliation, the first email will be confidential.  E-i-C. Smallbones(smalltalk) 21:45, 22 July 2021 (UTC)
"How to use or abuse Wikipedia for fun or profit": You have not proven that authors acted for "fun or profit". I find words "Only high quality sources may be used" absurd. Do they mean that Wikipedia allows low and middle quality sources in general? There is a discussion about the article, but I assume that 'The Signpost' is happy with the article.
So 'fun or profit'? Xx236 (talk) 11:49, 26 July 2021 (UTC)
@Smallbones: I think the headline on the column refers to the "In brief" items, especially Ronan Farrow, NRA editing, plagiarism, etc. not the death camp hoax. The title appeared immediately above another #1 subtopic concerning politicization of Chinese content until this edit moved it into its own article. Is a re-titling in order? It does seem like a poor juxtaposition at this point in time. - Bri.public (talk) 17:35, 26 July 2021 (UTC)


@Bri and Xx236: I can't tell you how sick I am of the "Fake death camp" story, even after all this time. My email and talk page and Signpost pages were inundated with pleas and accusations and counter pleas and counter-accusation for months, and nobody made any sense. I don't think that everybody involved was acting in bad faith, but nobody was trying to calmly communicate with me. I don't think "use or abuse for fun or profit" insults anybody in the case - it describes a wide range of possibilities and great uncertainty. I frankly cannot admit any fault here that I am aware of.  If anybody ever brings up the subject to me ever again, I'll just say "I don't deal with that story any more," and perhaps pass it along to another Signposter.  If Bri wants to change that headline to "This headline has been changed to prevent even the appearance of offence" he may. I'm done with this. Smallbones(smalltalk) 17:41, 22 August 2021 (UTC)
Another Larry Sanger article[edit]


Larry Sanger was interviewed in this article published in The Sunday Times on August 1. Should this be added to the next in the news? X-Editor (talk) 03:07, 2 August 2021 (UTC)




Seems like Sanger is the only person willing to criticize the present state of wikipedia: The website can no longer be trusted, according to the site’s co-founder, insisting it’s now just “propaganda” for the left-leaning “establishment”.[2] I wonder how many editors on this site dare to look in the mirror. 82.137.47.215 (talk) 13:47, 16 August 2021 (UTC)

Is he saying anything new? He was covered in the most recent issue. – Jonesey95 (talk) 16:13, 16 August 2021 (UTC)
Volunteering at the Signpost[edit]


It is unclear to me how to volunteer at this project other than as a contributing writer. The project states it's looking for editorial, publishing, and outreach help, too, but I can't seem to find out how to get involved in those capacities. Pyrrho the Skeptic (talk) 22:17, 29 September 2021 (UTC)

@Pyrrho the Skeptic: maybe start here then jump in with both feet! Good luck!   — WILDSTARtalk 22:33, 29 September 2021 (UTC)
Thanks for the response! Editors are encouraged to begin those tasks as they see fit, with no additional process, then? I've looked that page over a few times and maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see any place to "sign up", add name to list, or anything. Thanks again. —&nbsp;Preceding unsigned comment added by Pyrrho the Skeptic (talk • contribs) 00:38, 30 September 2021 (UTC)
Subscribe for a page outside of EnWiki[edit]


Hello! How can I subscribe for my user talk page in another language project? Is that possible? - Klein Muçi (talk) 02:43, 20 October 2021 (UTC)

Yes, there is a global distribution list. ☆ Bri (talk) 18:01, 20 October 2021 (UTC)
Vulnerability of English Wikipedia[edit]


An editor has been blocked. Now he attacks the English Wikipedia using traditional media and sockpuppeting. The Wikipedia persecutes weak editors using unacceptable geographical and national discriminations, but is unable to defend against a smart politically correct invider.
