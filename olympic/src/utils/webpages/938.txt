During today’s proceedings, the Session of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) elected one Vice-President, re-elected two members of the IOC Executive Board (EB) and elected one EB member. Following the recommendations made by the EB in June 2021, the Session also re-elected five Members, changed the status of one Member, and elected two Honorary Members.


IOC Executive Board


Ms Nicole Hoevertsz (IOC Member in Aruba) was elected by the IOC Session as Vice-President of the IOC; Dr Robin E. Mitchell (IOC Member in Fiji) and Mr Denis Oswald (IOC Member in Switzerland) were re-elected as IOC EB members; and Mrs Kristin Kloster (IOC Member in Norway) was newly elected to the Board.

The International Olympic Committee is a not-for-profit, civil, non-governmental, international organisation made up of volunteers which is committed to building a better world through sport. It redistributes more than 90 per cent of its income to the wider sporting movement, which means that every day the equivalent of USD 3.4 million goes to help athletes and sports organisations at all levels around the world.
