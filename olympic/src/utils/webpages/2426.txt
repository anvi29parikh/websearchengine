I've tried to install the infobox template forever but it won't work. I have tested another template from another wiki page and that don't work either. Both give the lua errors.



For example: Lua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:TNT' not found. Template:En-WP attribution notice (on the Template:infobox webpage)



and: Lua error in Modul:TNT at line 158: Missing JsonConfig extension; Cannot load https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data:I18n/Documentation.tab.





What is this and how am I suppose to solve this? One additional weird thing is that the other "info-box-type"-template from the other wiki does not "use" as much templates as my import according to the edit tab.



One thing I've noticed is that my lua version is 5.1.4 when every other wiki's I stumble upon use 5.1.5. I tried to install lua 5.1.5 but it didn't change the number...





Please help, I'm ripping my hair out...

I think 5.1.4 vs 5.1.5 might be a windows vs linux thing.

Even though Scribunto is updated and having the 5.1.5 engine of lua the Special:Version tab still says it's running lua 5.1.4!? Where does it grab that version??!!!

Ok, I've read it but I won't post link to it. Ask what you want to see and I shall send you a screenshot of it.





OS: Windows Server 2012 Datacenter (64-bit)



MediaWiki = 1.36.2



PHP = 7.3.32 (cgi-fcgi)



MySQL = 5.5.45



ICU = 64.2



Lua = 5.1.4





When I install "something" from "somewhere" I go to their Special:Export page and specify a template for example Template:PlayerTemplate and I check the box for "Include templates" and "Save as file". I then upload it with the Special:Import page on my wiki.

So first of all, if you want to use the TNT extension,you have to install Extension:JsonConfig and configure commons as a foreign data namespace. (Unfortunately the docs on doing that are a bit lackluster)





Are you getting both of these errors still? Because they kind of contradict each other (one is saying module:TNT is missing, the other is saying its there but has an error).

I have installed Extension:JsonConfig. "Configure commons as a foreign data namespace.", don't understand that.



No, I'm not right now it's only the Lua error in Modul:TNT at line 158: Missing JsonConfig extension; Cannot load ... that's the problem. (On the page for the Template:PlayerTemplate)



The infobox page has an additional text: "Template:En-WP attribution notice".



I get this red box when I go to the Module:TNT page. "fX01s0G" on imgur



The Template:PlayerTemplate also has a error that says: Lua error in Module:WikidataIB at line 665: attempt to index field 'wikibase' (a nil value).



The thing I said before that bothers me is that my importation of the template PlayerTemplate uses much more Templates than the one on the origin wiki...

Who is "their" in "their Special:Export page"? Where does "Configure commons as a foreign data namespace." come from / what displays that where? What "origin wiki"? How do you get to the conclusion in your last sentence (links)? Why is https://imgur.com/fX01s0G a 404 error? Why haven't you installed Wikibase if you'd like to use a module depending on it?

Their = The special:Export page on the page mentioned below.



It comes from the comment above from Bawolff, I didn't understand what he meant.



Origin wiki: 2b2t.miraheze.org



This (ibb.co JktP5Bz)is a picture of "used templates" in the template "PlayerTemplate" from 2b2t wiki. And this (ibb.co HGcj6Gt) is from my importation of the template "PlayerTemplate" onto my wiki. N.B. Mall (Swedish) = Template (English), Modul (Swedish) = Module (English.



Don't know, maybe because imgur is trash.



I have installed Wikibase...



The main problem right now seems to be the "Lua error in Module:TNT at line 158: Missing JsonConfig extension; Cannot load [link, cant post because of "linkspam"]." error that I seem to have on multiple templates.

Sorry for the spam. I fixed the Wikibase problem, it wasn't fully initialized. I still have the "Missing JsonConfig extension" problem though.

@Bawolff



I pasted those line of codes into LocalSettings.php and now I get this error: "Lua error in Modul:TNT at line 166: Missing Commons dataset I18n/Module:TNT.tab.". Now when I try to go onto pages I get error 500 - Internal server error. Often I can just reload the page and it works but when I try to import xml files through the "Special:Import"-page I get the 500 error and can't go past it...

@Bawolff



It's an error from IIS, I don't think I can solve that with editing debugging settings in the mediawiki folder...



Nevertheless, I've already applied the lines of code from the PHP errors part of the "How to debug"-page.

webserver 500s are commonly (but not exclusively) caused by php errors. IIS should also have some sort of logfile somewhere.

@Bawolff



Yeah, yeah. I've looked in the logs but those doesn't say much more. They just say "500 0 0 5314" or "500 0 0 2991" in the end of the line of the error. I just say that the site seems to be more unstable when I apply the changes to the LocalSettings.php you told about.



Whatever, that's not the main problem... I still can't understand the "Lua error in Module:TNT at line 166[...]".



And I think there is something wrong with the navbar/styles.css that I suppose would be handling the infoboxes position on the page. The "PlayerTemplate" is the only infobox working and it's on the left side of the page...





Why is it this difficult to just install a simple infobox?

Hi! I implemented a login solution with PluggableAuth in which I get via get the username and a token generated by the system that made the login request. What I need is that when there is an attempt to login, the system checks if the user has administrative rights and asks for a password to be compared with the bank's.
I have two problems:
1: How do I display a modal with an input and a button or a prompt dialog to capture this password?
2: How can I get the typed password and compare it with the bank because it is saved encrypted?



EDIT: 



It would be nice if you could change the $wgPluggableAuth_EnableLocalLogin variable to true dynamically in code

Hello,



I'd like to add a background image to my personal wiki page of a private wiki. If that's not possible, I'd like at least to be able to put the right side bar presenting me over the image. I have admin rights to edit whatever I want on the wiki but I have no idea on how to achieve that. Thanks.&nbsp;:)

One of the ways how you can do it is add CSS at Mediawiki:Common.css indicating the image and page

The body tag will have a class with the page name.





For example you might do




.page-Main_Page #content { background: url(/foo/bar/someimage.png); }




however, depending on your skin, you might need to target a different div then #content to place the actual background image on, im not sure. Also you need to make sure it has a high enough specificity to override any builtin rules.

In a translatable page translated to /zh, with "variant=zh_cn", something that should not be converted has been conterted. For example, in the , the word "æ—¥æœ¬èªž" in Japanese should not be converted to "æ—¥æœ¬è¯­".

The wiki is this wiki, MediaWiki.
Some URL links, for example, https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Cite/zh?variant=zh-cn

Sounds like a potential bug. See How to report a bug.

Hi All



I am tryingto install MediaWiki using Docker. I am using Windows, but want to use Docker so I have more scope of what I can do. Long term I want to create my own image so I can have Parsoid and GraphViz running on it.



The issue I am getting is when I go onto the database page of the installation I get:



Cannot access the database: php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not known (mysqlhost). 



Check the host, username and password and try again.





I have tried to create my own hostname for the MySQL running the line:



docker run --name=mysql1 -â€“network=mysqlhost -d mysql/mysql-server



But it comes up with the same error.



To get the container for MediaWiki working I have used:



docker run --name mediawiki -p 80:80 mediawiki



It looks like they are both working, just not talking to each other.



I have tried to link the MySQL up with MediaWiki as detailed on the MediaWiki Docker page using:



docker run --name mediawiki --link wiki:mysql -d mediawiki





But with that I get the error:





C:\Users\User&gt;docker run --name mediawiki --link wiki:mysql -d mediawiki
docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/mediawiki" is already in use by container  "eb03498d223748379186507fe6d58e1cb7f59f4f2de3e6e1ba863d5b8210bf3c". You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
See 'docker run --help'.




So I tried:



docker run --name wiki --link wiki:mysql -d mediawiki





But I get the error:




C:\Users\User&gt;docker run --name wiki --link wiki:mysql -d mediawiki
docker: Error response from daemon: could not get container for wiki: No such container: wiki.
See 'docker run --help'.




Not sure what I am doing wrong, any help is appreciated,

You use "docker run" to create a new container. Once you do that, you can't use the same name, unless you destroy that container. Try "docker rm mediawiki" to remove it and recreate it again.



Once you have the container created, and stop it, you can start it again with "docker start mediawiki"

I get that, I just can't seem to get the MediaWiki container to talk to the MySQL container. I found this which indicates the MySQL host is mysql in my case.

I have, but other work commitments came up. I am hoping to have a site down in the next few weeks now things are getting quieter again. But this is still an issue I am facing.

I had a similar issue.  When I used the database container name as the localhost, then I was able to complete the installation.  My container name was mariadb.

Hi, I want to draw your attention towards a problem on Sindhi Wikipedia that Arabic numbers are showing on whole wiki, each page, each section is in arabic digits its hard to understand and digits are too small to comprehension, Persho-Arabic_Sindhi numbers are not widely used nowadays and its very hard to comprehended. on the behalf of Sindhi Wikipedia community and as an admin I request to change the arabic numbers with either perso-Sindhi numbers or to English digits. suppose Ù¡Ù¤Ù¬Ù§Ù¨Ù¦ is arabic number (Ù¡Ù¤Ù¬Ù§Ù¨Ù¦ shows the current articles of sdwiki on special page). HERE IS THE CONSENSUS PAGE and VOTES FOr THIS CHANGE REQEUEST

@JogiAsad You already received an answer months ago in https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Requesting_wiki_configuration_changes#Request_for_English_numbering_on_Sindhi_Wikipedia. Why was this reposted?

Phabricator is the place to request this type of change. We at the support desk can't do anything about this. (Sorry. It sounds like there has been much back and forth on this topic which i imagine has been frustrating.)





Also just a note - the term "arabic numerals" in english more commonly refers to 1234567890 then the arabic letter style numerals, so it can be a bit of a confusing term in english.

I've attempted to give this a little prod on phabricator, to hopefully move things forward.



We (along with many other software projects) get translation data  from the CLDR project, so you could also try filing a bug with the CLDR project to change what they have marked as the correct way to write numerals in Sindhi - https://cldr.unicode.org/index/bug-reports

CLDR project request seems complicated at the moment I'll try again to understand its process to request changes. However this problem of arabic-sindhi numberals on sdwiki is still problematic. screenshot https://ibb.co/mNyQ0c1

Can you check for the actual error message? Maybe in the logs. Learn about how to enable debug logs here.
Be aware that this extension has external library dependencies. You may need to run composer update within the extensions directory as part of the installation. See also Composer/For_extensions and Manual:External_libraries

You can check this page and try to send message in this form? - antispoofing.org (not advertising).



And i'm enable debug in htaccess, and add "error_reporting( -1 );ini_set( 'display_errors', 1 );" in LocalSetting file, but there is nothing in the logs. 



I think I am because of the shorten URL.

Previously, this place had plain text, not bold. And suddenly, when simply updating the page, I (maybe everyone) updated the text to bold. You can revert back to the usual font, because it's not at all convenient to work with text (Content Translation tool).

And by the way, the top panel also disappeared. Watch the video link here about it (no link due to Wikimedia Foundation server problems).
