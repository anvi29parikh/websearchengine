                            International Olympic Committee spotlights winter sports with uplifting short film
                        

                        


                            The International Olympic Committee invites the world to celebrate the power that believing in each other has to unite, through a short film narrated by Olympic champion Lindsey Vonn. This evolution of the IOC’s Stronger Together campaign shines a spotlight on the jaw-dropping sports that take place on snow and ice.

        About the IOC

            The IOC is at the very heart of world sport, supporting every Olympic Movement stakeholder, promoting Olympism worldwide, and overseeing the regular celebration of the Olympic Games. The IOC is also committed to promoting sport in society, strengthening the integrity of sport and supporting clean athletes and other sports organisations.

        The IOC as an organisation
        
            Established in on 23 June 1894, the International Olympic Committee is a not-for-profit independent international organisation. Based in Lausanne, Switzerland, the Olympic Capital, it is entirely privately funded and distributes 90 per cent of its revenues to the wider sporting movement, for the development of sport and athletes at all levels.

            Gender equality
        
            
            Gender equality is a top priority for the Olympic Movement. The two main aims are to make access to sport in general and the Olympic Games easier for female athletes, and to increase the number of women in sports administration and management.
        
    




                
            IOC Refugee Olympic Team
        
            
            At the UN General Assembly in October 2015, confronted with the global refugee crisis that has seen an estimated 65.3 million people in the world displaced, IOC President Thomas Bach announced the creation of the Refugee Olympic Team to take part in the Olympic Games Rio 2016. Ten months on from the announcement, 10 athletes were competing alongside 11,000 fellow athletes in Brazil, sending a message of hope and inclusion to millions of refugees around the world and inspiring the world with the strength of their human spirit.
