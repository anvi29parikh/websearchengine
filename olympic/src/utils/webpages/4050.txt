See Checklists of current progress.

Why help to make sure that all articles have a short description?[edit]


Short descriptions appear in Wikipedia mobile and some desktop searches, and help users identify the desired article. When viewing an article, some mobile Wikipedia Apps also display the description below the page title. Short descriptions are likely to become more widely used, both within Wikipedia and by third parties, as the proportion of articles lacking one falls.


Articles that are lacking a short description appear in search result lists simply by their titles, with no annotation. If all titles were self-evidently clear, it would be immediately obvious which one relates to the article of interest, but very often that is not the case. Titles alone can be ambiguous or otherwise not comprehensible to non-specialist readers, as well as to readers who are not fluent speakers of English.

How to write  a short description[edit]


See Wikipedia:Short description.


The easiest way to add and edit short descriptions on desktop is to make use of Shortdesc helper. Alternatively, in the source code editor insert the short description template to the very top of the page, above all other article headers and templates. The format to use is {{Short&nbsp;description|Your short description here}}.


If a short description would be redundant you can use "none", thus:  {{Short description|none}}. See WP:SDNONE.

Adding and editing short descriptions[edit]


Short descriptions can be added and edited using the standard wiki markup editor (edit source), but it is often easier to enable Short description helper in Preferences | Gadgets, in the Editing section.

Editing using Shortdesc helper gadget[edit]
  Editing with shortdesc helper


If you click on (Edit), (Add), (Import), or (Edit and Import), it should open a small editing window in the third line with the current short description and give the options (Save) and (Cancel). Edit will import the description from Wikidata and allow you to change it before saving, while Import will import the Wikidata description as is and save. It can be edited later. Edit and Import will open the edit window with the Wikidata description and allow you to edit it before clicking on (Save) or (Cancel).


If adding a new short description, either type it in from the keyboard, or drag and drop from the article text and edit as appropriate.


By default, adding short descriptions to an article also adds the description to Wikidata if Wikidata has no description. This can be changed in the settings. To edit a short description that is already on Wikidata, click on one of the links (not shown in this example) in the Wikidata item description or Q-number to open the item at Wikidata.


Difference in formatting conventions for the description:

Wikidata: text always starting only with a lower case;
Short description in Wikipedia pages: Sentence case: Text starting with a first letter in upper case.


When the description does not yet exist in Wikidata and one types all the text in lower case using Shortdesc helper, it sends the description in lower case to Wikidata while simultaneously formatting the short description of the Wikipedia page in Sentence case. However, when exporting a modified short description back to Wikidata, it is not the case. Then, it is necessary to manually edit the Wikidata description to change the first Uppercase letter of the sentence into a lower case.


The Shortdesc helper will provide a standardised edit summary describing the edit.

Other useful scripts[edit]
The script User:SD0001/shortdescs-in-category shows the short descriptions of pages while viewing a category
The SDlinkBuilder user script helps you build a TODO list - taking all of the article links in a page and showing their current short descriptions.
What if I want to see the text that is used on Wikidata?[edit]


Wikidata maintains its own texts which are not linked in any way with Wikipedia short descriptions (although Short description helper can display the  Wikidata text to help editors construct a suitable description for Wikipedia). Wikipedia descriptions and Wikidata texts serve different purposes and are not required to be the same. If you want to view the Wikidata text, you can:

Configure Short description helper to show the Wikidata text at all times; or
Click on the Wikidata link in the sidebar to go directly to Wikidata, where you can view and edit the information.
Auto-generated and bot-generated descriptions[edit]


Semi-automated tools would be extremely helpful. If you can produce a script that is easy to use, checks through a category for the presence of short descriptions, and when absent checks for a Wikidata description and opens the page to allow the editor to check if it is suitable, then adds the description or allows manual addition and saves on a click before going on to the next article, it would accelerate the work by orders of magnitude.

Templates and modules[edit]


Templates and modules that are useful for this/created for helping with short descriptions:

Module:Plain text, for removing extraneous markup
Module:Type in location, for formatting input from |location= and getting shorter location
Module:Is infobox in lead, for checking if the infobox is the lead infobox and the only lead infobox
Template:Auto short description, for tagging templates that have code that automatically generates a short description.
See also Category:Modules that create a short description
Can I use the Wikidata text if it is good?[edit]


Yes, but only if it complies with the Wikipedia rules WP:SDFORMAT and WP:SDSHORT (typically no more than 40 characters). If it is good, you can copy it to Wikipedia in one click using the helper gadget, or choose to edit the text beforehand. There is no legal issue with copying, as all Wikidata texts are in the public domain.

Can I use a bot to copy over text from Wikidata?[edit]


No. The idea of bulk-importation from Wikidata has been rejected in an RFC. Wikidata texts are often not suitable as they are not subject to Wikipedia's policies, and have a different purpose.

Which articles can I work on?[edit]
Start with topics where you are sufficiently familiar to be able to write a good short description. If you run out, do anything that you are confident you can handle. If in doubt, leave it out.
If dealing with biographies, follow the WP:BLP policy scrupulously. Don't add a date of birth unless it is properly sourced in the article
Consider working though your watchlist (or part of it), or a WikiProject's articles, or a category
add the User:SD0001/shortdescs-in-category user script to help working on categories
If you like Outlines, work through one, they may be a good source of short descriptions if well annotated, and if not, you can annotate with the short descriptions as you create them.
All articles need a short description. Featured, Good, A and B class could be prioritised.
If you are a bot operator, there are bot tasks to be done.
If you don't have the time or inclination to work on this systematically:
consider just checking and adding a short description on articles that you will be editing anyway.
search for -incategory:"Articles with short description" -incategory:"Disambiguation pages" — this ignores any disambiguation pages, as they are being handled separately
What should I do about a bad short description?[edit]
Fix it: this is Wikipedia.
Follow Bold - Revert - Discuss, or you can start with Discuss in uncertain cases. The short description is just another piece of content.
In the case of a content dispute, get talk page consensus.
For a BLP violation, remove or preferably replace the description, providing an edit summary to explain.
