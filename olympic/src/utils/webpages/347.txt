The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) was created in 1983 to deal with the legal problems that an athlete could face.




IOC


The purpose of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) is to bring about the resolution of sports-related disputes which are submitted to it through ordinary arbitration or through appeal against the decisions of sports bodies or organisations.


In 1993 the CAS became entirely independent, by creating a new administration and financing body, the International Council of Arbitration for Sport (ICAS), and adopting a new judgement structure.


The CAS is recognised by the Paris Convention signed by the presidents of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF), the Association of the International Olympic Winter Sports Federations (AIOWF) and the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC), in the presence of the French Minister of Justice.
