Contrary to popular belief (and what the userbox says), Sdrqaz is not infallible.
If you have a compliment or comment or complaint to make about this user's edits, please visit the talk page to make them.


Sdrqaz—&nbsp;Wikipedian&nbsp;—Sdrqaz after editingPronounsWhatever floats your boat


Sdrqaz (/ˈsrʌkɑːz/ SRUH-kahz, alternatively /ˈsɜːrkɑːz/ SUR-kahz) is a volunteer Wikipedian. This user believes strongly in leaving edit summaries and despairs at those who do not, especially when making major edits. Sdrqaz is still bitter about PageTriage ending a good run of edit summaries.


Sdrqaz will occasionally use another account (golollop) and a shared IP address to edit Wikipedia. Given the infeasibility of interrogating its users individually, it is unknown if the network is used by other Wikipedians. No meatpuppetry or sockpuppetry will occur. Another account (sdrgaz) was created as a doppelgänger and was blocked, having made zero edits.


This user was once indefinitely blocked, with talk page access and email revoked a minute later. However, as the maxim goes, indefinite blocks are not infinite.


Wikipedia is not a&nbsp;soapbox. Policy states that this "applies to&nbsp;usernames, articles, drafts, categories, files, talk page discussions, templates, and user pages".




There's still a lot I don't know, a lot that I won't ever hope to know, and I won't ever be the smartest editor in the room. So if you see me getting full of myself, take me down a peg or two. I'll try and give it a healthy dollop of introspection.

On another note, this perspective on guidelines is well worth reading, and this response may have been the best thing to come out of RfA (though some candidates come close). For those confused with Wikipedia's jargon, see Wikipedia's very own glossary and alphabet soup of abbreviations.
