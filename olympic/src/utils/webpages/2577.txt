I've been lurking around Wikipedia for quite a few years now, but never edited before late 2020.  I saw what I considered vandalism in an article and decided to remove it.   Shortly after that I made some minor improvements to the wording at another article, at which point I said to myself "if you're actually going to start editing here you ought to go ahead and make an account," and here we are.  At the moment most of my editing revolves around removing vandalism and other disruptive or low quality editing.  I find it satisfying and it seems like a good way to contribute without being particularly time consuming.  My reading at Wikipedia has regularly included various talk pages and noticeboards.  I feel like that's given me a decent(ish) grasp of at least some of Wikipedia's policies, but the devil's in the details, and there are still many aspects of editing here that I am not experienced in.  If you see me doing something wrong or if there's something I can do to improve my editing please let me know.
