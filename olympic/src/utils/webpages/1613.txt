You've been absent for awhile[edit]


Hope everything is ok. Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk) 08:58, 13 June 2021 (UTC)

Same here. Crossroads -talk- 03:53, 1 August 2021 (UTC)
Ditto - hope you're OK Girth&nbsp;Summit (blether) 07:57, 7 August 2021 (UTC)
+1 to this. Your work at WP:RSN is unrivalled. — Bilorv (talk) 10:53, 23 October 2021 (UTC)
++1 to this. I hope you decide to return one day. You are missed. Tayi Arajakate Talk 19:33, 14 November 2021 (UTC)
Missed presence on RSN. Left an impression on a newbie. Hope to see you around again. --Chillabit (talk) 05:12, 16 November 2021 (UTC)
Appeal topic ban[edit]


Hey I created an appeal for a topic banned you created in March. I hope it can be repealed, due to my apologies for previous actions. Thanks have a good day. [1] 3Kingdoms (talk) 01:57, 19 July 2021 (UTC)

Listing of Forbes magazine[edit]


You appear to have contributed to the discussion of Forbes magazine as a reliable source last April which resulted in what looks like an odd addition to the Reliable Sources list for Forbes. It appears odd because "Forbes" is listed as reliable but "Forbes.com" is listed as unreliable. This does not appear to work because many of Forbes staff writers have they articles available on Forbes.com as that magazine's electronic data base. The current presentation of these two sources as on the one hand reliable and on the other hand unreliable appears further to be inconsistent since the Forbes staff writers have their articles in both places. Could you glance at this on the listing of reliable sources page since they are listed back-to-back? ErnestKrause (talk) 16:09, 19 July 2021 (UTC)

ErnestKrause, I would suggest taking a look at the list again, it refers to Forbes.com contributors as unreliable. Tayi Arajakate Talk 16:15, 19 July 2021 (UTC)
Thanks for getting back. The distinction of the two sources seems to say that Forbes.com is unreliable since it does not currently state an exception for Forbes staff writers. Also, since contributors do appear in the hard-copy version of the magazine, this distinction of staff versus contributor does not seem easy to apply. The hard-copy magazine which publishes both staff articles and contributor articles is reliable, but the contributors on Forbes.com, which include those published contributor articles in the hard-copy magazine, are unreliable? ErnestKrause (talk) 16:32, 19 July 2021 (UTC)
(talk page watcher) comment: The unreliable rating is applied specifically to Forbes.com contributors, not Forbes.com. For print articles by contributor, the description for Forbes.com contributors says Articles that have also been published in the print edition of Forbes are excluded, and are considered generally reliable. Schazjmd&nbsp;(talk) 16:40, 19 July 2021 (UTC)
You doing alright?[edit]


Hey. You doing alright Newslinger? You haven't edited in quite a while. NarSakSasLee (talk) 19:54, 8 August 2021 (UTC)

Maintenance tag[edit]


I'm not sure what my agenda is.  It would be nice to know what I'm supposed to fix.  My templates??  I wanna figure it out so I can move forward. GetWellSoonJun2921 (talk) 03:20, 22 August 2021 (UTC)

Notification[edit]


You are involved in a recently-filed request for clarification or amendment from the Arbitration Committee.

Additionally, the Wikipedia:Arbitration guide may be of use.


Thanks,--Nicoljaus (talk) 10:55, 10 September 2021 (UTC)

Where is Newslinger?[edit]


I'm sure someone knows something Renat 13:25, 20 September 2021 (UTC)

He was quite active in protecting the Love Jihad page from Hindu religious extremists from India for a long time. However, several Hindu nationalist forums online directly made threats to his life and also encouraged users to try and hunt him down. From what I can recall at the time he said he was aware of these threats but that didn't seem to have stopped him from editing? I'm hoping nothing has happened to him but you can't really tell with religious extremists. Several weeks ago there was a mass conference involving academics who wanted to discuss the problem of Hindu nationalism in the West and the reaction was horrendously visceral. I'm really hoping Newslinger is okay and hasn't come across anyone who could have threatened his life. Alternatively it could be possible that he's gotten COVID? NarSakSasLee (talk) 23:39, 29 September 2021 (UTC)
Amendment request: Nicoljaus, indef topic ban declined[edit]


The amendment request Amendment request: Nicoljaus, indef topic ban, has been declined by the Committee. You can review the closed amendement request here. For the Arbitration Committee, firefly ( t · c ) 12:00, 22 September 2021 (UTC)

You have been pruned from a list[edit]


Hi Newslinger! You're receiving this notification because you were previously listed on the AFC's participants list, but you haven't made any edits to the English Wikipedia in over 6 months. Because of your inactivity, you have been removed from the list. If you would like to regain access to the AFCH script, you can do so at any time by visiting WT:AFCP. Thank you for your work at AFC, and if you start editing Wikipedia again we hope you will rejoin us.

Ad Fontes Media and Media Bias/Fact Check[edit]


Both labeled "general unreliable" by Wikipedia users? [2]


Am I the only one who is troubled by this? EnlightenmentNow1792 (talk) 14:13, 12 November 2021 (UTC)

EnlightenmentNow1792 It concerns me that Wikipedia is ignoring the work of professional organisations set up to assess the reliability of news outlets. I've tried to use Media-bias/fact check to justify a reliability rating of sources, only to be faced with hostility, and even [one accusation] of being associated with the company! I think the [only criticism of Media Bias] is that it's seen as a primary source despite amalgamating decisions from a range of fact checkers. In fact [Wikipedia itself] says "Wikipedia employs no systematic mechanism for fact checking or accuracy"! Why? Perhaps our 'methodology' of deciding reliability ratings on Wikipedia needs to be discussed more generally!  --Andromedean (talk) 13:13, 13 November 2021 (UTC)
@EnlightenmentNow1792 and Andromedean: please don't post here. Newslinger hasn't been around for over 6 months, which is concerning. He's not going to reply and you need to have this discussion elsewhere. I'm sure you now that WP:RSN is the appropriate place. Doug Weller talk 11:50, 14 November 2021 (UTC)
@EnlightenmentNow1792: @Andromedean: User:Doug Weller is correct, this should be taken to WP:RSN — again. You are not the only one troubled by this. I started a discussion recently about it at Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard/Archive 350#Allsides.com media bias chart, revisited, but it didn't get anywhere. I'd like to see the Ad Fontes chart un-deprecated. If you start a new discussion, raise the points I raised, and I'm happy to participate. ~Anachronist (talk) 20:00, 14 November 2021 (UTC)
